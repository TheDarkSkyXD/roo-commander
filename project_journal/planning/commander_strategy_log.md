**Context:** Project reaching version 1.0 milestone

**Details:**
The Roo Commander project has officially reached version 1.0. This marks the transition from development to a stable release. The following key updates were made:

1. Updated CHANGELOG.md to move all unreleased changes to version 1.0.0 with today's date
2. Added a new section to README.md with recommended LLM models for specific modes:
   - Second Opinion mode: DeepSeek v3
   - UI Designer mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7
   - Tailwind CSS Specialist mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7
   - Frontend Developer mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7
   - Complex Problem Solver mode: Claude Sonnet 3.7 with thinking enabled

**Rationale:**
After extensive development and testing, the project has reached a level of maturity and stability warranting a 1.0 release. The model recommendations are based on testing and observed performance with different modes.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue gathering feedback on mode performance with different models
- Plan feature enhancements for future versions
- Consider expanding the model recommendations section as more testing is conducted

**Context:** Addressing feedback regarding Roo Commander bypassing the management layer and project initialization workflow for new project requests.

**Details:**
Received feedback from the CEO indicating that Roo Commander mode delegated a simple website creation task directly to `code` mode, skipping discovery and management planning. Also noted incorrect addressing ("user" instead of "CEO").

**Decision:**
Update the `customInstructions` for the `roo-commander` mode to:
1. Explicitly mandate following the `project_initialization_workflow.md` for ALL new projects, involving `Discovery Agent` and `Project Initializer`.
2. Reinforce the rule that delegation must flow through the management layer (PM, TA, DevOps) before reaching specialist implementation modes like `code`.
3. Add an instruction to always address the user as "CEO".

**Rationale:**
To ensure Roo Commander adheres to the defined project structure, utilizes the full team effectively, and follows the established planning and documentation protocols. Correct addressing improves the interaction quality.

**Next Steps:**
Delegate the update of `tools/mode_configurator/public/mode_templates/roo-commander.json` to the `code` mode with the revised instructions.

**Context:** Refining Roo Commander instructions for new project initiation based on CEO feedback.

**Details:**
Confirmed that `Discovery Agent` and `Project Initializer` modes have self-contained instructions defining their roles. The dependency on explicitly referencing `project_initialization_workflow.md` in Roo Commander's instructions can be removed.

**Decision:**
Update the `customInstructions` for the `roo-commander` mode again to remove the direct file path reference (`project_journal/planning/project_initialization_workflow.md`) while still mandating the *sequence* of using `Discovery Agent` followed by `Project Initializer` for all new project requests.

**Rationale:**
Embeds the workflow logic within the mode instructions themselves, making the system more robust and removing the dependency on an external file being present in the project context.

**Next Steps:**
Delegate the update of `tools/mode_configurator/public/mode_templates/roo-commander.json` to the `code` mode with the further revised instructions.

**Context:** Finalizing journaling strategy and adding personalization based on CEO feedback.

**Details:**
CEO approved the refined journaling strategy:
- Core planning docs (`project_plan.md`, `requirements.md`) remain single files.
- `commander_strategy_log.md` remains appended for narrative.
- `decision_log` entries become individual files: `decision_log/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_brief-decision-topic.md`.
- `technical_notes` entries become individual files organized by mode: `technical_notes/[mode_slug]/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_[topic_or_task].md`.

CEO also suggested adding personalization by asking for the user's name at the start of tasks.

**Decision:**
1. Update the "Project Journaling" section in the `customInstructions` of relevant modes (Roo Commander, PM, TA, DevOps, potentially specialists) to reflect the new granular file structure for decisions and technical notes.
2. Update the `customInstructions` for initiating modes (Roo Commander, Discovery Agent) to include a step for asking the user's preferred name and using it. Replace the "Always address the user as 'CEO'" instruction in Roo Commander's definition.

**Rationale:**
Improves log organization, searchability, and maintainability. Adds a valuable personalization touch to user interactions.

**Next Steps:**
Delegate updates to the relevant mode definition files (`*.json`) to the `code` mode.

**Context:** Addressing logic bug identified by CEO regarding progress monitoring in single-threaded environment.

**Details:**
CEO observed Roo Commander entering a loop, reporting implementation as "in progress" after delegation, despite Roo Code being single-threaded and requiring user interaction to execute delegated tasks sequentially. Roo Commander incorrectly assumed background execution.

**Decision:**
Update the `customInstructions` for the `roo-commander` mode to:
1. Explicitly acknowledge the single-threaded nature of task execution in Roo Code.
2. Modify the "monitoring" behaviour: Instead of reporting delegated tasks as "in progress", identify the next pending task based on the plan/log and prompt the user (CEO) on how to proceed with its execution (e.g., using `ask_followup_question` to suggest switching modes or confirming the next action).
3. Avoid using `attempt_completion` to imply background progress; use it only for genuine task completions *by this mode* or final project reporting.

**Rationale:**
To align Roo Commander's behaviour with the reality of single-threaded task execution, prevent misleading status reports, and correctly guide the user (CEO) on initiating the next step in the workflow.

**Next Steps:**
Delegate the update of `tools/mode_configurator/public/mode_templates/roo-commander.json` to the `code` mode with the revised instructions.

**Context:** Deprecating reliance on global custom instructions file based on CEO feedback.

**Details:**
CEO suggested removing reliance on `custom_instructions_for_all_modes.md` and incorporating essential instructions directly into relevant mode definitions for better maintainability and self-sufficiency.

**Decision:**
1.  Identify modes requiring specific global instructions (primarily the shell command generation rule).
2.  Add a condensed version of these critical instructions directly to the `customInstructions` of the identified modes (`git-manager`, `cicd-specialist`, `devops-manager`, `infrastructure-specialist` updated so far).
3.  Proceed with removing the `custom_instructions_for_all_modes.md` file from the repository.
4.  Ensure mode templates are self-contained going forward.

**Rationale:**
Improves mode portability, reduces complexity, avoids potential conflicts between global and mode-specific instructions, and aligns with the principle of self-contained mode definitions.

**Next Steps:**
- Commit the updated mode definition files (`git-manager.json`, `cicd-specialist.json`, `devops-manager.json`, `infrastructure-specialist.json`).
- Delegate the deletion of `custom_instructions_for_all_modes.md`.
- Commit the deletion.
