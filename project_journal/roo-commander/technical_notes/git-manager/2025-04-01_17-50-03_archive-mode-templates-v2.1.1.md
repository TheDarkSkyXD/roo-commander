## Git Operations
- Repository: roo-commander (local)
- Current Task: Archive current mode templates to v2.1.1-standardized-beta

### Operations Performed
1.  Identified current branch: `feature/standardize-mode-instructions`.
2.  Attempted to checkout commit `a38814c1e8f18a1f1a1a5e4e7e1f1a1a5e4e7e1f`, but it failed (invalid hash). Skipped checkout as per user instruction.
3.  Created directory `tools/mode_configurator/public/archived_mode_templates/v2.1.1-standardized-beta/`.
4.  Copied all `.json` files from `tools/mode_configurator/public/mode_templates/` to `tools/mode_configurator/public/archived_mode_templates/v2.1.1-standardized-beta/` on the `feature/standardize-mode-instructions` branch.
5.  Checked out the original branch `feature/standardize-mode-instructions`. (Note: Was already on this branch, but confirmed).

### Notes
- The purpose was to create an archive of the mode templates corresponding to version `v2.1.1-standardized-beta`.
- The invalid commit hash prevented checking out the specific state intended, so the files were copied from the current state of the `feature/standardize-mode-instructions` branch instead.
