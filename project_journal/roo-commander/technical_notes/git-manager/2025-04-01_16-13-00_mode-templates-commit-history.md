### Notes
- The search was conducted using UTC time range (2025-03-31T07:00:00Z to 2025-04-01T02:00:00Z) to cover the evening/late night period in Sydney time on March 31st.
- The last two commits technically fall into the early morning of April 1st Sydney time but were included based on the UTC conversion of the requested timeframe.
- The commits show a progression of updates to the mode templates, starting with a general update, followed by a fix to remove an invalid property, and finally a refactoring of the manifest.json file.
