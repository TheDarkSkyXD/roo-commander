### 2025-04-01 - Fix Mode Templates Source Property

**Context:** Corrected mode template files in `tools/mode_configurator/public/mode_templates/` by removing the invalid `"source": "custom"` property, following analysis and user request.

**Details:**
- Staged all modified `.json` files in `tools/mode_configurator/public/mode_templates/` using `git add`.
- Committed changes with message: "Fix: Remove invalid 'source' property from mode templates" (Commit: abaeb87).
- Attempted `git push`, which failed due to the local branch being behind the remote.
- Attempted `git pull --no-rebase`, which failed due to merge conflicts across multiple template files.
- User instructed to overwrite remote changes.
- Aborted the merge using `git merge --abort`.
- Force pushed the local commit `abaeb87` to the `main` branch on `jezweb/roo-commander` using `git push --force`.

**Rationale:** User explicitly requested overwriting remote changes after merge conflicts arose during the pull attempt, prioritizing the local fixes over integrating remote changes.

**Next Steps:** None.
