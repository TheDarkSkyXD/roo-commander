**Context:** Initializing project tracking for Mode Template Versioning (`mode-configurator-versioning`).

**Details:**
Created the initial project plan document at `project_journal/mode-configurator-versioning/planning/project_plan.md`. This plan outlines the main implementation tasks based on the existing schema/workflow (`versioning_schema_workflow.md`) and frontend plan (`frontend_plan.md`) documents.

**Next Steps:**
Begin assigning implementation tasks (#MCV-1, #MCV-2) to specialist modes (`frontend-developer`, `code`).

**Context:** Mode Configurator Versioning - File Structure Setup

**Details:**
Delegating the task to archive the current mode templates to the `project-initializer` mode. This involves creating the necessary directory structure and copying the template files to the versioned path (`tools/mode_configurator/public/archived_mode_templates/v2.1.0/`) as defined in `mode_versions.json`.

**Rationale:**
Ensures the file structure aligns with the versioning schema and allows the frontend selector to load archived templates correctly.

**Next Steps:**
Await confirmation from `project-initializer` upon task completion.

**Context:** Mode Configurator Versioning - Bug Fix

**Details:**
Delegating the task to fix the runtime error in `tools/mode_configurator/src/App.vue` to the `bug-fixer` mode. The fix involves adding conditional rendering (`v-if="selectedVersion"`) around template elements dependent on the `selectedVersion` data.

**Rationale:**
Prevent rendering errors by ensuring data is loaded before dependent template sections are rendered.

**Next Steps:**
Await confirmation of the fix from `bug-fixer`.

**Context:** Mode Configurator Versioning - Clarification & Next Steps

**Details:**
Discussed the content of the `v2.1.0` archive (pre-bugfix) versus the "latest" version (post-bugfix). User inquired about adding a version from "late last night". Clarified the process required: identify commit, create archive directory, copy files from commit, update `mode_versions.json`.

**Next Steps:**
Awaiting user decision on archiving the current "latest" state and clarification on the specific commit/timeframe for the "late last night" version.

**Context:** Mode Configurator Versioning - Version Clarification

**Details:**
User requested clarification on version mapping:
- Suggested `v2.1.0-nightly-20250331` (commit `548aebb`) could be `v2.0 stable`.
- Suggested `v2.1.0` (archived today pre-bugfix) is state from `main` this morning.
- Suggested archiving `feature/standardize-mode-instructions` branch as `v2.1.2-beta`.

Clarified current state:
- `v2.1.0` archive is indeed pre-bugfix state from today.
- `v2.1.0-nightly-20250331` is likely just a snapshot, not necessarily `v2.0 stable`.
- Current "latest" includes standardization work + bugfix.

Proposed refined plan based on identifying specific commits for `v2.0 stable` (if applicable) and the `feature/standardize-mode-instructions` branch completion.

**Next Steps:**
Awaiting user confirmation on commit hashes and approval of the refined versioning plan before proceeding with further archiving and `mode_versions.json` updates.

**Context:** Mode Configurator Versioning - Refined Version Clarification

**Details:**
Further discussion with user regarding version mapping based on commit history (`548aebb`, `a38814c`) and actions taken today (archiving pre-bugfix state, applying bugfix). Proposed a refined versioning scheme:
- `v2.0-stable` (if `548aebb` confirmed) or `v2.1.0-snapshot-20250331`
- `v2.1.0-standardized-beta` (for commit `a38814c`)
- `v2.1.1-stable-prebugfix` (for the currently archived `v2.1.0` state)
- `latest` (current state with bugfix)

**Next Steps:**
Awaiting user confirmation on specific commit mappings (v2.0 stable, standardization completion) and approval of the proposed naming/archiving plan.

**Context:** Mode Configurator Versioning - Final Versioning Plan

**Details:**
Based on user confirmation and commit analysis, the following versioning plan is finalized:
- **`latest`**: Current dev state (standardized, versioning UI, bugfix). Path: `tools/mode_configurator/public/mode_templates/`. Status: `development`.
- **`v2.1.1-standardized-beta`**: Archive of commit `a38814c` (standardization complete). Path: `archived_mode_templates/v2.1.1-standardized-beta/`. Status: `beta`.
- **`v2.1.0`**: Archive created today pre-bugfix (Snapshot C). Path: `archived_mode_templates/v2.1.0/`. Summary updated to "Standardized instructions, pre-versioning bugfix". Status: `stable`.
- **`v2.1.0-snapshot-20250331`**: Archive of commit `548aebb` (Snapshot A). Path: `archived_mode_templates/v2.1.0-nightly-20250331`. Status: `snapshot`. (Path kept for consistency with previous step, could be renamed later if desired).

**Rationale:**
Provides clear, distinct versions representing key stages of development and allows users to select them.

**Next Steps:**
1. Delegate archiving of `v2.1.1-standardized-beta` (commit `a38814c`) to Project Initializer.
2. Delegate final update of `mode_versions.json` to Code mode.
