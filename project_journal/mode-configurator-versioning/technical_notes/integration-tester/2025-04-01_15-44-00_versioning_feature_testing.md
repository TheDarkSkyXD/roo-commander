## Integration Test Notes: Mode Configurator Versioning

- **Project:** mode-configurator-versioning
- **Component Tested:** `tools/mode_configurator/src/App.vue`
- **Feature Tested:** Mode Template Versioning
- **Date:** 2025-04-01
- **Tester:** Roo Integration Tester

### Integration Points Tested

-   Fetching version metadata (`mode_versions.json`).
-   Updating the base path (`templateBasePath`) for loading mode templates based on the selected version.
-   Re-fetching the version-specific manifest (`manifest.json`) upon version change.
-   Re-fetching individual mode template files (`*.json`) from the correct version path upon version change.
-   Displaying version-specific information (status, summary) in the UI.
-   Handling errors related to fetching version metadata or mode manifests.

### Test Scenarios & Results (Based on Code Analysis)

1.  **Load Initial State:**
    *   **Description:** Verify the app loads correctly and defaults to the "latest" version.
    *   **Steps:** App initialization.
    *   **Expected:** "latest" selected, "Development" status shown, modes loaded from `/mode_templates/`.
    *   **Result:** PASS (Code analysis confirms correct initialization flow).

2.  **Switch to Archived Version (v2.1.0):**
    *   **Description:** Verify switching to an archived version loads the correct data and updates the UI.
    *   **Steps:** User selects "v2.1.0" from the dropdown.
    *   **Expected:** "v2.1.0" selected, "Stable" status shown, modes re-fetched from `/archived_mode_templates/v2.1.0/`. Mode list updates (though content source changes, the list itself remains the same as manifests are identical).
    *   **Result:** PASS (Code analysis confirms `handleVersionChange` correctly updates state, path, and re-fetches modes).

3.  **Switch Back to Latest:**
    *   **Description:** Verify switching back to the "latest" version restores the initial state correctly.
    *   **Steps:** User selects "latest" from the dropdown after selecting "v2.1.0".
    *   **Expected:** "latest" selected, "Development" status shown, modes re-fetched from `/mode_templates/`.
    *   **Result:** PASS (Code analysis confirms `handleVersionChange` correctly handles switching back).

4.  **Error Handling (Simulated):**
    *   **Missing `mode_versions.json`:**
        *   **Expected:** UI displays "Failed to load version data..." error.
        *   **Result:** PASS (Code analysis confirms `catch` block in `fetchVersions` sets the error state).
    *   **Missing `manifest.json`:**
        *   **Expected:** UI displays "Failed to load mode data..." error when trying to load modes for that version.
        *   **Result:** PASS (Code analysis confirms `catch` block in `fetchModes` sets the error state).
    *   **Missing individual mode file:**
        *   **Expected:** Console error logged, mode omitted from UI list, no top-level UI error shown.
        *   **Result:** PASS (Code analysis confirms graceful handling of individual file fetch errors).

### Known Issues/Observations

-   The manifests for "latest" and "v2.1.0" are currently identical. While the *source* of the mode data changes correctly upon version switch, the *list* of modes displayed in the UI does not change. This is expected given the current manifests but might be confusing if users expect different mode availability between versions. This is not a bug in the versioning *logic* itself, but a consequence of the current data.

### Conclusion

The versioning feature logic within `App.vue` appears functionally correct based on code analysis. It correctly handles switching between versions, loading data from appropriate paths, and managing basic error states.
