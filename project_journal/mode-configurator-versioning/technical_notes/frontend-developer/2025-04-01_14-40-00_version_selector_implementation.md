## Frontend Implementation
- Feature: Mode Template Version Selection
- Status: In Progress
- Last Updated: 2025-04-01

### Components
- **VersionSelector**: Dropdown component for selecting template versions
  - Props: None (uses global state)
  - States: 
    - `modeVersions`: Array of version objects from mode_versions.json
    - `selectedVersion`: Currently selected version object
    - `templateBasePath`: Base path for template loading
  - Key functionality: 
    - Displays available versions with status indicators
    - Handles version selection changes
    - Updates template path based on selection

### Dependencies
- Vue.js: Core framework for reactive UI
- No additional external libraries required

### State Management
The implementation uses Vue's Composition API with reactive state:

1. **Version-related State**:
   - `modeVersions`: Stores all available versions from mode_versions.json
   - `selectedVersion`: Tracks the currently selected version
   - `templateBasePath`: Stores the base path for template loading

2. **Data Flow**:
   - On component mount: Fetch version metadata → Set default version → Determine template path → Fetch mode templates
   - On version change: Update selected version → Update template path → Reset selections → Reload mode templates

3. **State Persistence**:
   - State is maintained within the component and not persisted between sessions
   - Default selection is always "latest" version on initial load

### API Integration
- **Local File Endpoints**:
  - `/roo-commander/mode_versions.json`: Fetches version metadata
  - `/roo-commander/${templateBasePath}manifest.json`: Fetches mode manifest for selected version
  - `/roo-commander/${templateBasePath}${filename}`: Fetches individual mode templates

- **Data Handling**:
  - Version metadata is parsed and stored in reactive state
  - Template paths are dynamically constructed based on selected version
  - Error handling for failed fetches with appropriate user feedback

### Performance Considerations
- **Fetch Optimization**: 
  - Sequential fetching (versions → manifest → templates) to ensure correct data dependencies
  - Consider implementing caching for previously loaded versions to avoid redundant network requests

- **UI Responsiveness**:
  - Clear loading indicators during version switching
  - Debounce version selection changes if needed to prevent rapid switching

- **Error Recovery**:
  - Fallback to "latest" version if selected version fails to load
  - Graceful degradation with informative error messages

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Ensure dropdown is fully keyboard accessible
  - Implement proper focus management

- **Screen Reader Support**:
  - Add appropriate ARIA attributes to the version selector
  - Include descriptive labels for status indicators

- **Visual Distinctions**:
  - Use both color and text to indicate version status (not just color alone)
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast for status indicators

### Browser/Device Testing
- Chrome/Edge: Pending
- Firefox: Pending
- Safari: Pending
- Mobile Responsiveness: Pending

### Known Issues/TODOs
- [ ] Consider adding a confirmation dialog when switching versions if there are unsaved selections
- [ ] Implement caching mechanism for previously loaded versions
- [ ] Add unit tests for version selection logic
- [ ] Consider adding a visual indicator (icon) for each version status in addition to color
