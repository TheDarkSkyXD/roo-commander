## Bug Fix
- Bug ID: AppVue_TypeError_selectedVersion_null
- Reported: 2025-04-01 (Inferred from task)
- Fixed: 2025-04-01
- Affected version(s): Current development version of mode_configurator

### Description
A runtime TypeError occurred in `tools/mode_configurator/src/App.vue`: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'version') at Proxy._sfc_render (App.vue:259:36)`. This happened because the template attempted to access `selectedVersion.version` before the `selectedVersion` reactive variable was initialized by the `fetchVersions` asynchronous operation.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Load the `tools/mode_configurator/index.html` page.
2. Observe the JavaScript console for the TypeError.

### Root Cause Analysis
The `selectedVersion` reactive variable is initially `null`. The template code within the `<select>` element (specifically `v-model="selectedVersion.version"` on line 259) tries to access a property (`version`) of this null object during the initial render cycle, before the `fetchVersions` function completes and assigns a valid object to `selectedVersion`.

### Fix Implementation
- Files changed: `tools/mode_configurator/src/App.vue`
- `tools/mode_configurator/src/App.vue:255`: Added `v-if="selectedVersion"` directive to the `div` with class `version-dropdown`.
- Approach: Conditionally render the version selector dropdown (`<select>`) and its parent `div` only after `selectedVersion` has been initialized. This prevents the template from trying to access properties of a null object during the initial render.

### Regression Testing
- Test added: Manual verification that the page loads without errors.
- Test location: N/A (manual testing)
- Other verified scenarios: Verified that the version selector appears correctly after data is loaded.

### Validation
- Environments verified: Local development environment
- Edge cases considered:
  - Initial page load before data fetching completes
  - Slow network conditions where data fetching takes longer

### Lessons Learned
1. Always ensure that reactive variables used in templates have default values or are conditionally rendered with `v-if` to prevent null/undefined property access errors.
2. For asynchronous data loading in Vue applications, implement proper loading states and conditional rendering to handle the period before data is available.
3. Consider adding a loading indicator during the data fetching process to improve user experience.
