**Context:** Evaluating user suggestion to allow frontend-developer mode direct documentation writing via 'browser mode'.

**Details:**
User Jeremy suggested modifying the workflow to allow the frontend-developer mode (using Claude Sonnet) to write its own documentation, potentially using browsing capabilities, to avoid handoff to `code` mode. Evaluated against current architecture:
    - File writing is centralized via delegation to `code` mode for control, consistency, and adherence to `project_journal` structure.
    - Specialist modes typically lack direct, unrestricted file write access.
    - "Browser mode" isn't a standard tool granting file writing. Specific web MCPs exist but don't change mode permissions.
    - Mode file path restrictions are in place.
    - Current workflow: Specialist generates content, Commander delegates writing to `code` mode.

**Decision:** Maintain the current workflow. Specialist modes generate documentation *content*, but file writing/appending, especially to `project_journal`, remains delegated to `code` mode by the Commander.

**Rationale:** Ensures controlled file system access, maintains workflow consistency, and adheres to established `project_journal` structure and permissions. Modifying this would require significant changes to mode capabilities and restrictions.

**Next Steps:** Informed user Jeremy of the decision and rationale.

**Context:** Reviewing mode interactions and documentation strategy based on user feedback regarding potential weaknesses in handoffs.

**Details:**
Analyzed the standard workflow (Discovery -> Initializer -> Management -> Specialists) and the role of the `project_journal`.
*   **Strengths:** Centralized journal, structured directories, existing instructions for saving technical notes/formal docs in most modes.
*   **Weaknesses Identified:**
    *   Over-reliance on `attempt_completion` results for critical data transfer (volatile). Addressed for `discovery-agent` by adding explicit save delegation.
    *   Implicit context dependency (context window limits).
    *   Potential lack of context in task definitions delegated via `new_task`.
    *   Difficulty in discovering relevant changes made by other specialists.
*   **Proposed Refinements:**
    1.  **Reinforce Saving Outputs:** Update mode instructions to explicitly state that critical outputs *must* be saved to `project_journal` via delegation *before* `attempt_completion`.
    2.  **Reference Saved Artifacts:** Instruct delegating modes (PM, TA, etc.) to include file paths to relevant saved documents in `new_task` messages.
    3.  **Clarify `attempt_completion` Purpose:** Instruct modes to use `attempt_completion` for summaries and *references* to saved detailed outputs.

**Rationale:** To improve the robustness of information handoffs between modes by prioritizing persistent storage (`project_journal`) over volatile context window memory or `attempt_completion` results for critical data.

**Next Steps:** Awaiting user confirmation to proceed with updating mode instructions based on these refinements.
