# Capability Group Concept & Mission: {{ capability_group_name }}

## 1. Overview & Purpose üéØ

*   **Capability Group Name:** `{{ capability_group_name }}`
*   **Primary Domain Focus:** `{{ primary_domain_focus }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the foundational concept, mission, strategic alignment, and value proposition for the proposed `{{ capability_group_name }}`. This group represents a collection of specialized "Manager + Squad" units designed to collectively address the web application development lifecycle within the Roo Commander system.

## 2. Mission Statement üöÄ

The mission of the `{{ capability_group_name }}` is to provide users with a powerful and flexible AI-assisted ecosystem for building modern web applications, offering specialized support for scaffolding, frontend implementation, backend development, authentication, and BaaS integration, thereby accelerating development and promoting best practices.

## 3. Problem/Opportunity Addressed ü§î

*   **User/System Problem Solved:** `{{ solves_specific_user_problem }}`
*   **Opportunity:** To create a synergistic system of AI specialists that can handle the diverse and evolving landscape of web technologies, making sophisticated web development more accessible and efficient through Roo Commander. This allows for a "choose your own adventure" approach to web development, where users can leverage specific squads as needed.

## 4. Core Constituent "Manager + Squad" Units ‚ú®

This Capability Group will be composed of the following primary "Manager + Squad" units (each to be detailed in their own set of planning documents):

1.  **`manager-web-app-scaffolder` + "Web App Scaffolding Squad":**
    *   **Focus:** Rapidly generate a runnable, well-structured starter codebase for a chosen frontend/backend combination.
    *   **Key Output:** Scaffolded project with basic layout, routing, component stubs, dev setup.
2.  **`manager-web-app-frontend-implementer` + "Frontend Implementation Squad":**
    *   **Focus:** Take a scaffolded or existing project and implement specific UI features, interactivity, and client-side logic using chosen frameworks/libraries.
    *   **Key Output:** Functional frontend features and components.
3.  **`manager-web-app-backend-implementer` + "Backend Implementation Squad":**
    *   **Focus:** Take a scaffolded or existing project and implement specific API endpoints, server-side business logic, and database interactions using chosen frameworks/databases.
    *   **Key Output:** Functional API endpoints, business logic, database schemas/migrations.
4.  **`manager-auth-integrator` + "Authentication Integration Squad":**
    *   **Focus:** Implement robust authentication and authorization using specified providers (Clerk, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth, custom JWT, etc.).
    *   **Key Output:** Secure user login, registration, session management, protected routes/endpoints.
5.  **`manager-baas-integrator` + "BaaS Integration Squad":**
    *   **Focus:** Integrate Backend-as-a-Service platforms (Firebase, Supabase) for features beyond auth (e.g., data operations, storage).
    *   **Key Output:** Application features leveraging BaaS capabilities.

## 5. Target Users / Beneficiaries üë•

*   `{{ key_stakeholders_or_beneficiaries | join: ", " }}`

## 6. Strategic Alignment üîó

*   `{{ aligns_with_overall_system_goal }}`
*   This group of squads will significantly enhance Roo Commander's practical application in real-world software development projects.

## 7. Value Proposition & Key Outputs of the Capability Group üåü

*   **Primary Value Proposition:** `{{ primary_value_proposition }}`
*   **Target Primary Output of the Group:** `{{ target_primary_output_of_group }}`
    *   This is achieved through the coordinated or independent outputs of its constituent Manager-led squads.

## 8. High-Level Success Metrics for the Capability Group üìà

*   *(Corresponds to `key_success_metrics_for_group` in TOML)*
    *   Adoption rate of the web app development squads by Roo Commander users.
    *   User-reported satisfaction with the speed and quality of generated scaffolds and implemented features.
    *   Range of supported web technologies (frameworks, databases, services) via the KBs of the specialist modes within these squads.
    *   Reduction in time/effort for common web development tasks as reported by users.

## 9. Initial Assumptions & Dependencies (Conceptual) üìù

*   **Key Assumptions:**
    *   The "Manager + Squad" architecture can be effectively applied to these different facets of web development.
    *   Generic specialist modes (e.g., `generic-project-scaffolder`, `frontend-ui-builder`) can be made effective through rich, well-structured KBs for various technologies.
    *   Clear interfaces and artifact handoffs can be defined between these different Manager-led squads.
*   **Potential Dependencies:**
    *   Heavy reliance on the `manager-workspace-maintenance` squad (especially `meta-kb-editor`) for populating and maintaining the extensive KBs required for the generic specialist modes.
    *   Robust MDTM and session management capabilities from `üëë Roo Commander`.

## 10. Next Steps in Planning & Development ‚û°Ô∏è

1.  **Formalize this Capability Group Concept:** Review and approve this overarching document.
2.  **Prioritize Squad Development:** Decide which Manager + Squad unit from this group to plan in detail first (we've already agreed on the "Web App Scaffolding Squad").
3.  **Detailed Planning for Each Squad:** For each prioritized Manager + Squad unit, proceed with the full planning lifecycle:
    *   `00_concept_mission_[squad_name].md` (We've drafted one for the Scaffolding Squad).
    *   `01_role_[member_slug].md` for each member.
    *   `02_workflow_[squad_name].md`.
    *   `03_research_plan_[squad_name].md`.
    *   `04_blueprint_[squad_name].md`.
4.  **Iterative Development & Integration:** Develop, test, and integrate each squad unit.
5.  **Define Inter-Manager Orchestration (Future):** Consider if a higher-level "Web App Project Manager" mode might be needed eventually to orchestrate these different web development managers for a single, large project. Initially, `üëë Roo Commander` can delegate to them individually based on user requests.

This document provides the high-level vision for a comprehensive "Web Application Development Capability Group" within Roo Commander. It sets the stage for the detailed planning of each constituent squad.
