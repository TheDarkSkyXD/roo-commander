# Squad Workflow & Artifact Flow: {{ squad_unit_name_ref }}

## 1. Overview üó∫Ô∏è

*   **Workflow Name:** `{{ workflow_name }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Managing Mode (Conceptual):** `{{ managing_mode_slug_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the sequential operational flow for the `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`.

This document is essential for designing the main orchestration procedure of the `{{ managing_mode_slug_ref }}`.

## 5. Key Dependencies & Handoff Points üîó

*   The entire workflow is highly sequential, with the output of one phase being a critical input for the next.
*   `tech_stack_recommendation_v1.md` is a pivotal artifact influencing many subsequent steps.
*   The `Scaffolded Project Directory Path` created by `generic-project-scaffolder` becomes the working context for most subsequent file-creating modes.
*   Clear definition of output file paths and structures in each MDTM sub-task by `manager-web-app-scaffolder` is crucial.

## 6. Considerations for the Managing Mode (`{{ managing_mode_slug_ref }}`) üß†

*   The `{{ managing_mode_slug_ref }}`'s main KB procedure (`01-main-orchestration-flow.md`) will meticulously detail this 10-phase sequence.
*   It must carefully manage the `input_artifacts` and `output_artifacts` for each MDTM sub-task, ensuring correct `.roo/` anchored paths are used.
*   It needs to handle potential user interaction (via `üëë Roo Commander`) during the Requirements Clarification and Tech Stack Advisement phases.
*   Error handling at each phase is important; if a phase fails, subsequent phases may not be able to proceed.

This document provides the blueprint for the operational sequence of the `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`.
