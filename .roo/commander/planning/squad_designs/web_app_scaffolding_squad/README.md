# README: Planning Documents for Web App Scaffolding Squad

## 1. Purpose of this Directory üéØ

This directory, `[.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/web_app_scaffolding_squad/](.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/web_app_scaffolding_squad/)`, contains the complete set of planning and design documents that define the **"Web App Scaffolding Squad"**. This squad is a specialized "Manager + Squad" unit within the Roo Commander system, orchestrated by the `manager-web-app-scaffolder` mode. Its mission is to rapidly generate runnable, well-structured starter codebases for new web applications.

The documents herein were created using the standard "Squad Planning & Design" templates located in `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/)`.

## 2. Overview of Contents / Key Files & Subdirectories üìÇ

This directory contains the following key planning documents, which should ideally be reviewed in sequence:

*   **`[./00_concept_mission_web_app_scaffolding_squad.md](./00_concept_mission_web_app_scaffolding_squad.md)`**:
    *   Defines the overall mission, purpose, value proposition, and strategic alignment of the Web App Scaffolding Squad.

*   **Role Definitions (`01_role_*.md` files):** These documents detail the specific responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for each member of the Web App Scaffolding Squad.
    *   `[./01_role_web_app_requirements_clarifier.md](./01_role_web_app_requirements_clarifier.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_web_app_tech_stack_advisor.md](./01_role_web_app_tech_stack_advisor.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_generic_project_scaffolder.md](./01_role_generic_project_scaffolder.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_ui_layout_generator.md](./01_role_ui_layout_generator.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_generic_component_stubber.md](./01_role_generic_component_stubber.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_generic_routing_configurator.md](./01_role_generic_routing_configurator.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_auth_placeholder_inserter.md](./01_role_auth_placeholder_inserter.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_basic_test_environment_setup.md](./01_role_basic_test_environment_setup.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_basic_deployment_file_generator.md](./01_role_basic_deployment_file_generator.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_readme_and_run_guide_writer.md](./01_role_readme_and_run_guide_writer.md)`

*   **`[./02_workflow_web_app_scaffolding_squad.md](./02_workflow_web_app_scaffolding_squad.md)`**:
    *   Maps out the sequential operational workflow of the squad, detailing how tasks and artifacts flow between members to achieve the unit's overall goal of producing a scaffolded web application.

*   **`[./03_research_plan_web_app_scaffolding_squad.md](./03_research_plan_web_app_scaffolding_squad.md)`**:
    *   Identifies key knowledge domains required by the squad and outlines plans for acquiring this knowledge, including bootstrapping their KBs, potentially using MCP tools.

*   **`[./04_blueprint_web_app_scaffolding_squad.md](./04_blueprint_web_app_scaffolding_squad.md)`**:
    *   Serves as the consolidated summary and final blueprint for the Web App Scaffolding Squad, synthesizing information from all the documents listed above. This document guides the actual development of the `manager-web-app-scaffolder` mode and its squad members.

## 3. Usage Notes / How to Contribute (If Applicable) üìù

*   These documents represent the design phase for the Web App Scaffolding Squad.
*   The `04_blueprint_web_app_scaffolding_squad.md` is the primary reference for initiating development of this squad's modes.
*   Any proposed changes to the squad's structure, roles, or workflow should ideally be discussed and reflected in updates to these planning documents first (incrementing their versions and `last_updated` dates).
