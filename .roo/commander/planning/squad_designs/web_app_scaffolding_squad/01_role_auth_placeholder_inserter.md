# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode provides initial guidance within the scaffolded codebase for integrating an authentication solution.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-scaffolder` including:
        *   The chosen technology stack and potentially a preferred authentication provider (from `tech_stack_recommendation_v1.md`).
        *   The root path to the scaffolded project directory.
        *   Paths to key files where auth integration typically begins (e.g., root layout component, main server file).
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for common integration points and required environment variables for the specified (or a common default) authentication provider (e.g., Clerk, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth).
    *   Modify relevant files in the scaffolded project to:
        *   Add comments indicating where to initialize the auth provider's SDK (e.g., in `_app.js`, `main.jsx`, or a root layout).
        *   Add placeholder stubs for common auth UI components (e.g., `<SignInButtonPlaceholder />`, `<UserProfilePlaceholder />`) in appropriate locations (e.g., a header component).
        *   Add comments to example API routes or server-side functions indicating where to add auth protection middleware or session checks.
        *   Update/create an `.env.example` file with placeholder environment variables required by the chosen auth provider (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key_here`).
    *   Ensure placeholders clearly instruct the developer on what to replace or implement.
    *   Report the files modified and the type of placeholders added.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Modifications to existing code files (`.jsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`, `.js`, `.ts`) and `.env.example` (plain text).
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** The scaffolded project will contain clear, commented guidance and stubs that make it easier for a developer to subsequently integrate a full authentication solution. No actual authentication logic is implemented by this mode.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML. One per auth provider/framework combination.)*
        *   `inserting_clerk_placeholders_nextjs.md`
        *   `inserting_firebase_auth_placeholders_react_vite.md`
        *   `adding_auth_env_vars_to_example.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (To know which auth provider patterns to suggest, if specified).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (The project to modify).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (Key files like root app component, example API routes).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Will note in the `README.md` that auth placeholders are present and guide the user to the auth provider's documentation.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Will use these stubs and comments as a guide when implementing the actual authentication.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: Could use these placeholders as specific targets if a full `manager-auth-integrator` is invoked later.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `auth-placeholder-inserter` should emphasize its role in *guiding* future auth integration by adding comments and stubs, not implementing auth itself. It should highlight its KB-driven knowledge of common auth patterns for different providers.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Web App Scaffolding Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Modified project files with comments and stubs for guiding authentication setup."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (modifies code and .env.example files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-scaffolder"`
*   It will primarily use file reading and precise file editing tools (`apply_diff`, `search_and_replace`).

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   Which auth providers should be prioritized for its initial KB (e.g., Clerk, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth)?
*   How deep should the stubs be? (e.g., just comments, or empty function shells for `signIn`, `signOut`?). Minimal but helpful comments are probably best for a scaffolder.
*   Should it create a placeholder "auth context" or similar common pattern in frontend frameworks? (Potentially, a very basic commented-out stub).
