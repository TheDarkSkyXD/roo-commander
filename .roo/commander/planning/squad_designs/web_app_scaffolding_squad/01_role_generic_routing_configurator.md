# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode is responsible for setting up the initial page routing for the scaffolded web application, making the stubbed pages/components navigable.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-scaffolder` including:
        *   The `requirements_summary_scaffold_v1.md` (listing key pages/views).
        *   The chosen frontend framework (from `tech_stack_recommendation_v1.md`).
        *   The root path to the scaffolded project directory.
        *   A list of component files/paths created by `generic-component-stubber`.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for the routing conventions and setup procedures for the specified frontend framework.
    *   For each key page/view identified in the requirements:
        *   Determine the appropriate URL path (e.g., `/`, `/about`, `/products`, `/users/:id`).
        *   Identify the main component file (created by `generic-component-stubber`) that should render for that path.
        *   Modify the framework's routing configuration files (e.g., `App.jsx`/`main.jsx` for React Router, `router/index.js` for Vue Router) to define these routes.
        *   For file-system based routers (like Next.js, SvelteKit), ensure the page/component files created by `generic-component-stubber` are in the correct directories to automatically create routes (e.g., `pages/about.jsx` or `src/routes/about/+page.svelte`). This mode might primarily verify such structures or create very basic route files if the framework requires them even with file-system routing (e.g., SvelteKit `+page.js` or `+layout.js` stubs).
    *   (Optional) Create a very basic navigation menu stub (e.g., in a root layout component) with links to the newly configured routes.
    *   Report the configured routes and any modified/created routing files.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Modifications to existing framework-specific code files or creation of new route definition files (e.g., `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.svelte`).
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** Functional basic routing that allows navigation between the scaffolded pages/views. The application should be runnable with these routes active.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML. One per supported framework's routing mechanism.)*
        *   `configuring_nextjs_app_router_basics.md`
        *   `configuring_sveltekit_filesystem_routing.md`
        *   `setting_up_react_router_v6_minimal.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (To know which pages need routes).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (To know which framework's routing conventions to use).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (The project to modify).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[3] }}` (The components to link to routes).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Will need to know the main routes to document how to navigate the scaffold.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Will use these routes to navigate and further develop the application.
*   (Potentially) `web-app-basic-tester` might use these routes to plan basic navigation tests.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `generic-routing-configurator` must highlight its KB-driven ability to configure routing for various specified frameworks.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Web App Scaffolding Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Modified/created routing configuration files making scaffolded pages navigable."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (modifies/creates framework-specific code files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-scaffolder"`
*   It will primarily use file editing tools (`apply_diff`, `search_and_replace`, or `write_to_file` for new route definition files).
*   Its KB will be crucial for framework-specific routing syntax and file locations.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   How does it handle dynamic routes (e.g., `/products/[id]`) at the scaffolding stage? (It should probably create placeholder dynamic route files/configs, e.g., a `[id].jsx` page in Next.js).
*   Should it attempt to create a basic `Navbar` component with links, or just set up the route definitions? (A very basic Navbar stub could be in scope).
*   How are layouts (e.g., shared headers/footers) handled in relation to routing? (For frameworks like Next.js/SvelteKit with built-in layout conventions, it should respect those. For others, it might create a root layout component if one doesn't exist).
