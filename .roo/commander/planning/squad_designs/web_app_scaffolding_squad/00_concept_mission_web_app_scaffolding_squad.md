# Squad Concept & Mission: {{ squad_unit_name }}

## 1. Overview & Purpose üéØ

*   **Squad Unit Name:** `{{ squad_unit_name }}`
*   **Proposed Managing Mode:** `{{ proposed_managing_mode_name }}` (`{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}`)
*   **Primary Domain Focus:** `{{ primary_domain_focus }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the foundational concept, mission, strategic alignment, and value proposition for the proposed `{{ squad_unit_name }}`. This unit is dedicated to rapidly creating starter codebases for web applications.

## 2. Mission Statement üöÄ

The mission of the `{{ squad_unit_name }}`, orchestrated by the `{{ proposed_managing_mode_name }}`, is to provide a comprehensive, AI-assisted service for rapidly generating well-structured and runnable starter projects for new web applications, guiding users from high-level requirements to a foundational codebase ready for immediate further development.

## 3. Problem/Opportunity Addressed ü§î

*   **User/System Problem Solved:** `{{ solves_specific_user_problem }}`
*   **Opportunity:** To dramatically reduce the initial setup time and cognitive load for starting new web projects, enforce good structural practices from the outset, and allow developers to bypass boilerplate to focus on unique application logic more quickly. This squad enables rapid exploration of web application ideas with different tech stacks.

## 4. Core Capabilities of the Unit ‚ú®

The `{{ squad_unit_name }}` will, through its specialist members, be capable of:
*   Clarifying high-level requirements for the web application scaffold (key pages/views, essential features as stubs, overall style).
*   Advising on or confirming suitable frontend frameworks, backend approaches (if any for the scaffold), UI libraries, and basic auth/deployment considerations.
*   Generating the initial project directory structure and core configuration files (`package.json`, build tool configs, linters, `tsconfig.json`, `.env.example`) for the chosen tech stack.
*   Creating basic HTML/CSS (e.g., Tailwind CSS) layouts for the identified key pages/views.
*   Generating placeholder/stub component files (e.g., `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`) within the scaffold, based on the layouts and chosen framework.
*   Configuring basic page routing to make the scaffolded pages navigable.
*   Inserting comments and stubs to guide future integration of authentication.
*   Setting up a basic testing framework configuration and example empty test files.
*   Generating a minimal deployment configuration file (e.g., `Dockerfile`, `vercel.json`).
*   Producing a `README.md` file with project overview, setup instructions, and how to run the development server.

## 5. Target Users / Beneficiaries üë•

*   `{{ key_stakeholders_or_beneficiaries | join: "; " }}`.
*   Developers needing to quickly prototype ideas or start new projects with a solid foundation.

## 6. Strategic Alignment üîó

*   `{{ aligns_with_overall_system_goal }}`
*   This squad directly supports the goal of making Roo Commander a practical assistant for common software development tasks, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for new web projects.

## 7. Value Proposition & Key Outputs üåü

*   **Primary Value Proposition:** `{{ primary_value_proposition }}`
*   **Target Primary Output of the Unit:** `{{ target_primary_output_of_unit }}`
    *   The output is a developer-friendly, runnable starting point, not a feature-complete application. It emphasizes correct setup, structure, and basic navigability.

## 8. High-Level Success Metrics for the Unit üìà

*   *(Corresponds to `key_success_metrics_for_unit` in TOML)*
    *   Time taken to generate a runnable scaffold from initial requirements.
    *   Adherence of the scaffold to chosen framework conventions and best practices.
    *   Completeness and correctness of the initial setup (build tools, dependencies, basic configs).
    *   Clarity and usefulness of the generated `README.md` and developer guidance.
    *   User satisfaction with the ease of getting started with the scaffolded project.

## 9. Initial Assumptions & Dependencies (Conceptual) üìù

*   **Key Assumptions:**
    *   AI modes can be effectively specialized for each scaffolding sub-task (requirements, stack advice, file generation, config writing).
    *   "Generic" specialist modes can leverage their KBs effectively to handle multiple frameworks for tasks like project setup, component stubbing, and routing.
    *   Users can provide sufficiently clear high-level requirements for a scaffold.
*   **Potential Dependencies:**
    *   Relies on well-maintained KBs for the generic squad members, to be populated by `meta-kb-editor` (from Workspace Maintenance Squad).
    *   May interact with `devops-dependency-manager` for ensuring `package.json` files are correctly formatted or for actually installing dependencies post-scaffold.
    *   Uses standard templates for its own planning documents and for the `README.md` it generates.

## 10. Next Steps in Squad Design ‚û°Ô∏è

*   Define individual Squad Member Roles for the `{{ squad_unit_name }}` using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md]`. (We have already drafted these: `web-app-requirements-clarifier`, `web-app-tech-stack-advisor`, `generic-project-scaffolder`, `ui-layout-generator`, `generic-component-stubber`, `generic-routing-configurator`, `auth-placeholder-inserter`, `basic-test-environment-setup`, `basic-deployment-file-generator`, `readme-and-run-guide-writer`).
*   Map out the Squad Workflow and Artifact Flow using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_02_squad_workflow_and_artifact_flow.md]`.
*   Plan Knowledge Acquisition and Research for the squad members using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_03_squad_knowledge_and_research_plan.md]`.
*   Consolidate into a Squad Design Summary & Blueprint using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_04_squad_design_summary_and_blueprint.md]`.
