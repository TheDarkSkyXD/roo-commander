*   **Total Squad Members Proposed:** `{{ number_of_squad_members }}`

## 5. Workflow & Artifact Flow Overview üîÑ

The squad operates in a sequential pipeline, managed by `{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}`. Each member takes inputs from previous members (or initial requirements) and produces artifacts that feed into subsequent steps, culminating in a complete project scaffold. The detailed flow is documented in `{{ linked_workflow_doc }}`.

**Visual Flow (High-Level - Refer to detailed diagram in `{{ linked_workflow_doc }}`):**
```mermaid

```

## 6. Key Knowledge & Research Requirements Summary üìö

The effectiveness of this squad, particularly its "generic" members, relies on comprehensive KBs detailing procedures for various frameworks and tools. Key research areas (detailed in `{{ linked_research_plan_doc }}`) include:
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[0] }}`
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[1] }}`
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[2] }}`
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[3] }}`
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[4] }}`
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[5] }}`
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[6] }}`
*   Initial KBs will need to be populated for common stacks (e.g., Next.js/React, Vite/Vue, SvelteKit, Astro for frontend; Jest/Vitest/Playwright for testing; Docker/Vercel/Netlify for deployment).

## 7. Proposed Next Steps for Development üõ†Ô∏è

1.  **Architectural Review and Approval:** Finalize and approve this Squad Design Blueprint.
2.  **Manager Mode Definition:** Create the `.mode.md`, rules, and initial KB (README, main orchestration procedure, squad composition reference) for `{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}`.
3.  **Squad Member Mode Definitions:** For each of the 10 squad members listed:
    *   Create their `.mode.md` file using `[.roo/commander/templates/modes/squad/template_00_squad.mode.md]`, populating from their respective Role Definition documents.
    *   Create their `[.roo/rules-[slug]/00-[slug]-core-principles.md]` file.
4.  **KB Bootstrapping:** Begin populating the KBs for the generic specialists (`generic-project-scaffolder`, `generic-component-stubber`, `generic-routing-configurator`, `basic-test-environment-setup`, `basic-deployment-file-generator`, `auth-placeholder-inserter`) with procedures and reference material for 1-2 initial target frameworks/tools, based on the Research Plan. This will be an ongoing task for `meta-kb-editor`.
5.  **Template Creation:** Design and create the new templates identified:
    *   `[.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/web_app_dev/template_scaffold_requirements_summary.md]`
    *   `[.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/web_app_dev/template_tech_stack_recommendation.md]`
    *   `[.roo/commander/templates/project_root/template_README_scaffolded_app.md]`
6.  **Integration:** Update `üëë Roo Commander`'s KB to make `{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}` available.
7.  **Iterative Testing:** Conduct end-to-end testing of the scaffolding workflow for an initial target stack.

This blueprint provides a comprehensive plan for developing the `{{ squad_unit_name }}`.
