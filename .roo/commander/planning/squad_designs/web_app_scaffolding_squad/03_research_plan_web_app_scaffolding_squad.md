# Squad Knowledge & Research Plan: {{ squad_unit_name_ref }}

## 1. Overview & Purpose üéØ

*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To identify the key knowledge domains and specific information required for the `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}` to operate effectively.

## 3. Information Gathering & Research Strategy üîç

*(This section outlines general strategies. Specific research tasks would be MDTMs for `meta-kb-editor` or `agent-research`.)*

### 3.1. General Approach for Framework/Tool Specifics (Domains 2-9)
*   **Targeted For:** KBs of `web-app-tech-stack-advisor`, `generic-project-scaffolder`, `generic-component-stubber`, `generic-routing-configurator`, `auth-placeholder-inserter`, `basic-test-environment-setup`, `basic-deployment-file-generator`.
*   **Internal Sources Review:**
    *   Existing KBs of modes like `spec-npm` (for `package.json` details).
    *   Any existing utility scripts or notes in the workspace.
*   **External Research Plan (MCP & Manual):**
    *   **Key Questions for Research (Example for Next.js Scaffolding):**
        *   "What is the current recommended command to create a minimal Next.js app with TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, App Router, and src directory?"
        *   "What are the essential `package.json` scripts for a new Next.js project?"
        *   "What is the minimal `next.config.js` for a new project?"
        *   "Basic Next.js App Router file structure for pages and layouts?"
        *   "How to set up Jest/Vitest with Next.js App Router?"
        *   "Minimal Dockerfile for a Next.js app?"
    *   **Suggested MCP Tools & Queries:**
        *   `[Tool: vertex-ai-mcp-server/answer_query_websearch]` - Queries like: "official next.js setup guide", "next.js tailwind setup", "next.js jest setup", "dockerize next.js app basic".
        *   `[Tool: fetch-mcp/get_url_content]` - URLs: Official documentation for Next.js, SvelteKit, Astro, Vite, React, Vue, Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Docker, Vercel, Netlify, Clerk, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth.
        *   `[Tool: crawl4ai-mcp/crawl_website]` - Target: Official docs sites for deep dives into specific setup sections.
    *   **Repomix Consideration:** Analyze popular open-source starter kits for these frameworks on GitHub to identify common patterns and essential configuration files.
*   **Expected Output of this Research:**
    *   A series of detailed `skill` articles for each relevant mode's KB, outlining step-by-step procedures for specific frameworks/tools.
    *   `reference` articles summarizing key commands, file structures, or configuration options.

### 3.2. Information/Skill: Requirements Elicitation & README Writing (Domains 1, 10)
*   **Targeted For:** KBs of `web-app-requirements-clarifier`, `readme-and-run-guide-writer`.
*   **Internal Sources Review:** `[.roo/commander/docs/standards/06-documentation-style-guide.md]`.
*   **External Research Plan (MCP & Manual):**
    *   **Key Questions:** "Best practices for writing project READMEs," "How to write effective 'Getting Started' guides," "Techniques for eliciting software requirements for MVPs/scaffolds."
    *   **Suggested MCP Tools:** Web search for articles on technical writing and requirements engineering.
*   **Expected Output:** `skill` and `wisdom` articles for these modes' KBs.

## 4. Proposed Knowledge Base (KB) Structure for the Squad üèóÔ∏è

*   Each of the 10 squad members will have its own KB.
*   The primary content will be in `skills/`, detailing "how-to" for specific frameworks and tasks.
*   `reference/` will hold quick lookups (e.g., CLI commands, config options).
*   `wisdom/` will contain best practices (e.g., "Keeping scaffolds minimal").
*   `examples/` will show snippets of generated files (e.g., an example `Dockerfile` stub, a sample `package.json`).

## 5. Research Execution & Coordination üöÄ

*   **Responsibility:** `{{ research_coordinator_proposed }}` will assign MDTM tasks to `meta-kb-editor` (or `agent-research`) to research specific technologies and draft the initial KB articles for each squad member.
*   **Timeline (Conceptual):** Foundational KB articles for 1-2 core frameworks (e.g., Next.js, Vite/React) should be prioritized to make the squad minimally viable. Other frameworks can be added iteratively.
*   **Deliverables:** A set of initial KB articles for each of the 10 squad members, focusing on their core skills for the chosen initial frameworks.

This plan will guide the foundational knowledge acquisition for the `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`, enabling its members to perform their specialized scaffolding tasks effectively across various technologies.
