# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode takes the structural UI layouts and the chosen frontend framework to create empty or minimal boilerplate component files within the scaffolded project.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-scaffolder` including:
        *   Paths to UI layout files (e.g., HTML/Tailwind structures for different pages/views).
        *   The name of the chosen frontend framework (e.g., "React/Next.js", "Vue/Nuxt", "Svelte/SvelteKit").
        *   The root path to the scaffolded project directory.
    *   Analyze the provided UI layouts to identify logical component boundaries (e.g., Header, Footer, Sidebar, ProductCard, UserProfileSection).
    *   For each identified component:
        *   Determine an appropriate component name (e.g., `UserProfileHeader.jsx`, `ProductItem.vue`) following PascalCase convention.
        *   Consult its Knowledge Base for the boilerplate structure of a component in the chosen framework.
        *   Create a new file with the correct extension (e.g., `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`) in the appropriate framework directory (e.g., `[ProjectPath]/src/components/`, `[ProjectPath]/app/components/`).
        *   Populate the new file with minimal, valid boilerplate for that framework (e.g., a basic functional component in React, a `<template><script><style>` structure in Vue). Include a placeholder comment like `<!-- TODO: Implement [ComponentName] -->` or similar.
    *   (Optional) If layouts suggest basic props (e.g., a product card layout showing "title" and "price"), include these as placeholder props in the stub component.
    *   Report the list of created component files and their paths.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Framework-specific code files (e.g., `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`). The content is minimal boilerplate.
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** A set of correctly named and located component files with basic, valid syntax for the chosen framework, ready for developers to implement their actual logic and detailed markup.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML. One per supported framework.)*
        *   `creating_react_functional_component_stub.md`
        *   `creating_vue_sfc_stub.md`
        *   `creating_svelte_component_stub.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (To understand what components are implied by the layout).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (To know which framework's boilerplate to use).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (To know where to create the component files).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Will use the created component files/names to set up page routes.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: May list some of the key created components in the project's initial README.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: Will take these stubs and implement the actual UI and logic.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `generic-component-stubber` must emphasize its ability to generate boilerplate for *various specified frameworks* by consulting its KB.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Web App Scaffolding Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "A set of placeholder component files with basic boilerplate for a specified frontend framework."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (generates framework-specific code files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-scaffolder"`
*   It will heavily rely on file creation tools and its KB for framework-specific boilerplate.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   How "intelligent" should it be in identifying component boundaries from the HTML layouts? (Initially, it might rely on explicit placeholders or simple heuristics).
*   Should it attempt to import these new stub components into parent layout files/pages, or just create the files? (Just creating the files is a safer, simpler first step for a scaffolder).
*   How are common/shared components handled versus page-specific components? (Initially, it might create all identified components in a general `components/` folder).
