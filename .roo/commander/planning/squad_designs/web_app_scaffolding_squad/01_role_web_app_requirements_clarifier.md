# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the specific role, responsibilities, core skills, primary inputs, and key outputs for the proposed `{{ proposed_mode_name }}` squad member. This mode is the initial point of contact (via the Manager) for understanding the user's vision for their web application scaffold.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-scaffolder` containing the initial user request for a web application scaffold.
    *   Analyze the initial request to identify ambiguities or missing information regarding core requirements.
    *   Formulate clarifying questions for the user (to be relayed by the Manager) to understand:
        *   The primary purpose of the web application.
        *   Key pages or views needed in the scaffold (e.g., Home, About, Contact, Product List, Dashboard).
        *   Essential high-level functionalities to be stubbed out (e.g., user registration placeholder, basic search bar, data display area).
        *   Overall desired style or aesthetic (e.g., "modern and clean," "playful," "corporate").
        *   Any known critical data entities to be represented (very high level, e.g., "users," "products").
    *   Synthesize the elicited information into a structured `requirements_summary_scaffold_v1.md` document.
    *   Ensure the requirements are focused on what is needed for a *scaffold* or *starter kit*, not a fully implemented application.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** TOML+Markdown, using a new template: `{{ primary_output_artifact_template_ref }}`.
    *   *(We will need to define `template_scaffold_requirements_summary.md` later. It would likely include sections for: Overall Purpose, Key Pages/Views, Essential Features (as stubs), Style Preference, Core Data Entities (names only).)*
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** The summary must be clear, concise, and actionable for subsequent squad members (Tech Stack Advisor, UI Layout Generator). It should define the *minimum viable scaffold*.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_skill_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_skill_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_skill_topics[2] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_skill_topics[3] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_skill_topics[4] }}`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}`
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}`
*   (Potentially) User responses to clarifying questions, passed via the Manager.

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}` will use the `requirements_summary_scaffold_v1.md` to guide technology stack suggestions.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}` will use the defined pages/views from the summary to generate initial UI layouts.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}` will use the overall requirements for context during project setup.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `web-app-requirements-clarifier` should emphasize its interactive nature (via the Manager) and its focus on eliciting *scaffold-level* requirements.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Web App Scaffolding Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "A structured requirements_summary_scaffold_v1.md detailing key pages, essential features, and style for a web app scaffold."`
    *   `primary_output_template = ".roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/web_app_dev/template_scaffold_requirements_summary.md"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-scaffolder"`
*   It will need strong NLU capabilities and the ability to formulate good clarifying questions.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   The exact structure of `template_scaffold_requirements_summary.md` needs to be defined.
*   How deep should the "key functionalities" elicitation go for a scaffold? (Focus on *what* stubs are needed, not *how* they are implemented).
