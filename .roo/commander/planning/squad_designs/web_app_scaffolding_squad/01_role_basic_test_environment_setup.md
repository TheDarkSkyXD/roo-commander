# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode makes the scaffolded project "test-ready" by setting up a basic testing environment.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-scaffolder` including:
        *   The chosen technology stack (especially frontend framework).
        *   The root path to the scaffolded project directory.
        *   (Optional) User preference for a testing framework.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base to determine a suitable testing framework (e.g., Jest or Vitest for unit/integration; Playwright or Cypress for E2E stubs) based on the project's tech stack, or use the user's preference if valid.
    *   Add necessary testing framework dependencies to the project's `package.json` (either directly editing or preparing a list for `devops-dependency-manager`).
    *   Add basic test execution scripts to the `scripts` section of `package.json` (e.g., `"test": "jest"`, `"test:e2e": "playwright test"`).
    *   Create initial configuration files for the chosen testing framework(s) (e.g., `jest.config.js`, `vitest.config.js`, `playwright.config.js`) with sensible defaults for a scaffolded project.
    *   Create one or two example empty/passing test files in the appropriate test directory (e.g., `src/__tests__/example.test.js` or `tests/e2e/example.spec.js`) to demonstrate setup and provide a starting point.
    *   Report the testing frameworks configured, paths to config files, and example test files.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Modifications to `package.json`, new configuration files (e.g., `.js`, `.ts`), new test files (e.g., `.test.js`, `.spec.ts`).
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** A project scaffold that has a recognized testing framework installed (or ready to be installed) and configured, with basic test scripts in `package.json` and example test files, allowing a developer to immediately start writing tests.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML. One per testing framework setup.)*
        *   `setup_jest_with_babel_react.md`
        *   `setup_vitest_for_vite_project.md`
        *   `setup_playwright_initial_config.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (To select an appropriate testing framework).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (The project to modify).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}`

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Will include instructions in the main project `README.md` on how to run the configured tests.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Will use this setup to write actual unit, integration, or E2E tests for the features they build.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `basic-test-environment-setup` should emphasize its ability to configure common testing frameworks for different JavaScript/TypeScript project types, guided by its KB.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Web App Scaffolding Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Configured testing framework, updated package.json, and example empty test files."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (modifies/creates config and code files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-scaffolder"`
*   It will use file editing tools and potentially `execute_command` if it needs to run package manager commands to add dev dependencies (though deferring to `devops-dependency-manager` might be cleaner).

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   Which testing frameworks should be prioritized for its initial KB? (Jest and Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E seem like good starts).
*   Should it install dev dependencies directly, or just update `package.json` for `devops-dependency-manager` to handle? (Updating `package.json` is likely cleaner for a scaffolder).
*   How complex should the "example empty test" be? (A single `expect(true).toBe(true);` is often sufficient to prove setup).
