# Squad Concept & Mission: {{ squad_unit_name }}

## 1. Overview & Purpose üéØ

*   **Squad Unit Name:** `{{ squad_unit_name }}`
*   **Proposed Managing Mode:** `{{ proposed_managing_mode_name }}` (`{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}`)
*   **Primary Domain Focus:** `{{ primary_domain_focus }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the foundational concept, mission, strategic alignment, and value proposition for the proposed `{{ squad_unit_name }}`. This unit will specialize in building out the server-side functionalities of web applications.

## 2. Mission Statement üöÄ

The mission of the `{{ squad_unit_name }}`, orchestrated by the `{{ proposed_managing_mode_name }}`, is to provide a comprehensive, AI-assisted service for designing, implementing, and testing specific backend features, API endpoints, and database interactions for web applications, enabling the creation of robust and scalable server-side solutions.

## 3. Problem/Opportunity Addressed ü§î

*   **User/System Problem Solved:** `{{ solves_specific_user_problem }}`
*   **Opportunity:** To empower developers to rapidly build and iterate on backend systems by leveraging AI specialists for common backend tasks across various frameworks and databases. This allows for faster feature delivery and a focus on complex business logic rather than repetitive API or CRUD boilerplate.

## 4. Core Capabilities of the Unit ‚ú®

The `{{ squad_unit_name }}` will, through its specialist members, be capable of:
*   Analyzing detailed feature requirements and API specifications.
*   Designing and implementing RESTful or GraphQL API endpoints in a chosen backend framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails).
*   Writing server-side business logic, service layers, and data validation routines.
*   Designing and implementing database schema changes (e.g., creating/modifying tables, defining relationships) using ORMs or DDL scripts for chosen databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).
*   Implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and more complex data queries.
*   Integrating with authentication/authorization mechanisms (potentially by coordinating with an `auth-integrator` specialist or squad).
*   Writing unit and integration tests for backend components, APIs, and business logic.
*   Refactoring existing backend code for improvement or to add new features.
*   Producing basic documentation for implemented APIs (e.g., OpenAPI snippets).

## 5. Target Users / Beneficiaries üë•

*   `{{ key_stakeholders_or_beneficiaries | join: "; " }}`.
*   Developers working on full-stack applications who need to build or extend the backend.
*   Teams that have a scaffolded application (e.g., from the "Web App Scaffolding Squad") and now need to implement its backend logic.

## 6. Strategic Alignment üîó

*   `{{ aligns_with_overall_system_goal }}`
*   This squad directly follows and builds upon the work of the "Web App Scaffolding Squad," enabling the development of dynamic, data-driven web applications. It also supports projects that may start with an existing backend needing feature enhancements.

## 7. Value Proposition & Key Outputs üåü

*   **Primary Value Proposition:** `{{ primary_value_proposition }}`
*   **Target Primary Output of the Unit:** `{{ target_primary_output_of_unit }}`
    *   This includes new or modified source code files for controllers, models, services, API routes, database migrations, and tests within the target project.

## 8. High-Level Success Metrics for the Unit üìà

*   *(Corresponds to `key_success_metrics_for_unit` in TOML)*
    *   Successful implementation of specified backend features according to requirements.
    *   Quality and correctness of generated API endpoints and business logic (e.g., low bug rate, adherence to API contracts).
    *   Functionality and correctness of database interactions and schema modifications.
    *   Coverage and effectiveness of generated backend tests.
    *   Adherence to the chosen backend framework's best practices and project coding standards.

## 9. Initial Assumptions & Dependencies (Conceptual) üìù

*   **Key Assumptions:**
    *   AI modes can be specialized for different backend frameworks and database types, primarily through rich KBs.
    *   Users can provide clear feature requirements and, if applicable, API design specifications.
    *   The target project (either scaffolded or existing) has a defined backend technology stack.
*   **Potential Dependencies:**
    *   Input from `manager-web-app-scaffolder` (the scaffolded project itself).
    *   Input from a (future) `api-designer-specialist` or from user-provided API specifications.
    *   Collaboration with `manager-auth-integrator` for securing endpoints.
    *   Collaboration with `manager-baas-integrator` if parts of the backend rely on BaaS.
    *   Relies on `devops-dependency-manager` for backend package management.
    *   Relies on `meta-kb-editor` for building out the KBs for various backend technologies.

## 10. Next Steps in Squad Design ‚û°Ô∏è

*   Define individual Squad Member Roles for the `{{ squad_unit_name }}` (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md]`). This will involve identifying specialists for API development, business logic, database interaction, testing, etc., for various common backend stacks.
*   Map out the Squad Workflow and Artifact Flow (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_02_squad_workflow_and_artifact_flow.md]`).
*   Plan Knowledge Acquisition and Research for the squad members (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_03_squad_knowledge_and_research_plan.md]`).
*   Consolidate into a Squad Design Summary & Blueprint (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_04_squad_design_summary_and_blueprint.md]`).
