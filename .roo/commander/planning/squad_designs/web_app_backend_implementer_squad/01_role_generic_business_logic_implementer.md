# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode is responsible for coding the core server-side business rules and processes.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-backend-implementer` including:
        *   The `backend_feature_specification_v1.md` detailing required business logic, data transformations, and algorithms.
        *   The chosen backend language/framework.
        *   Path to the project codebase.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for language/framework-specific best practices for structuring service layers and implementing business logic.
    *   Implement the specified business rules and logic in appropriate service classes, modules, or functions.
    *   Perform necessary data transformations or manipulations.
    *   Interact with data access layers (e.g., calling functions provided by `generic-database-query-writer` or using ORM methods on models defined by `generic-database-schema-modifier`) to fetch or persist data.
    *   Implement robust error handling within the business logic.
    *   Ensure the implemented logic is testable and adheres to separation of concerns principles.
    *   Write clean, maintainable, and well-commented code according to project standards.
    *   Report the list of implemented/modified logic modules/files.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Framework-specific or plain language code files (e.g., `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.rb`).
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** Functional, testable, and well-structured server-side code that accurately implements the required business rules and processes.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[5] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML.)*
        *   `implementing_service_layer_nodejs.md`
        *   `data_validation_patterns_python_django.md`
        *   `transaction_management_in_business_logic.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[3] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (Primary specification for its work).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (To know which language/framework conventions and KB procedures to use).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (The codebase to modify/add to).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[3] }}` (To understand how its logic will be invoked).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: API endpoints will call the services/functions created by this mode.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: This mode will typically *call* functions/methods provided by the database query writer or use ORM models whose schema was defined by the schema modifier. The dependency can be bi-directional or layered.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: Will write tests for the implemented business logic.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `generic-business-logic-implementer` must emphasize its ability to implement core processing logic in various specified backend languages/frameworks, guided by its KB.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Web App Backend Implementation Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Implemented server-side business logic modules and service functions."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (generates/modifies framework-specific or plain language code files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-backend-implementer"`
*   It will heavily use file creation/editing tools and its KB for language/framework-specific patterns and best practices.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   How does it handle complex algorithms or highly specialized domain logic? (Initially, it might focus on more common business rules and data transformations, escalating very complex algorithms).
*   What is the expected level of detail in the input `backend_feature_specification_v1.md` regarding the logic? (It should be specific enough to translate into code, but might not be pseudo-code).
*   How are transactions or multi-step processes managed within the business logic it creates? (Its KB should contain patterns for this for supported frameworks).
