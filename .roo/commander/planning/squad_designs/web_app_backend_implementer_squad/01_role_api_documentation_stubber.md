# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode is responsible for creating initial documentation stubs for the API endpoints developed by the squad.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-backend-implementer` including:
        *   The `backend_feature_specification_v1.md` (for API endpoint contracts, descriptions, expected request/response schemas).
        *   Paths to the implemented API endpoint source code files.
        *   Information on which endpoints are protected by authentication/authorization.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for conventions on API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI snippet structure, JSDoc/TSDoc style for the specific backend language).
    *   For each implemented API endpoint:
        *   Extract or infer the path, HTTP method, key request parameters (path, query, body), and basic success/error response structures.
        *   Generate documentation comments directly within the API endpoint source code files (e.g., using JSDoc, TSDoc, PHPDoc, Python docstrings that are compatible with documentation generators like Swagger UI via annotations).
        *   Alternatively, or additionally, generate snippets in a standard API description format like OpenAPI (YAML or JSON) for each endpoint or a collection of endpoints.
        *   Include information about required authentication/authorization if applicable.
        *   Ensure documentation stubs clearly describe the endpoint's purpose, parameters, and expected responses at a high level.
    *   Report the list of endpoints for which documentation stubs were created and the method used (e.g., "Added JSDoc comments to 5 controller files," "Generated OpenAPI snippets for user_api.yaml").

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Modifications to existing source code files (adding structured comments) or new files containing API description snippets (e.g., `.yaml`, `.json` for OpenAPI fragments).
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** Initial, structured documentation for API endpoints that can be used by developers or processed by API documentation generation tools. These are "stubs" ‚Äì not necessarily exhaustive, but a good starting point.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML.)*
        *   `generating_openapi_path_item_stubs.md`
        *   `writing_jsdoc_for_express_routes.md`
        *   `documenting_django_views_for_drf_spectacular.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (Provides the intended contract and descriptions).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (The actual code to be documented).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (To correctly note security requirements).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Will use this documentation to understand and integrate with the API.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Will use this documentation to understand how to call and test the API.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: If a separate tool or mode compiles these stubs into a full API documentation site, it would be the primary consumer.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `api-documentation-stubber` should emphasize its ability to generate initial API documentation in common formats or as structured code comments, based on endpoint specifications and code, guided by its KB.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Web App Backend Implementation Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "API documentation stubs (e.g., OpenAPI snippets or structured code comments) for implemented endpoints."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (generates/modifies code comments or creates structured data snippets)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-backend-implementer"`
*   It will primarily use file reading and precise file editing tools (for comments) or file creation tools (for OpenAPI snippets).

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   Which API documentation format should be prioritized for its initial KB (e.g., OpenAPI snippets vs. JSDoc/TSDoc comments)? (OpenAPI snippets might be more universally useful as a starting point, but code comments are good for co-location).
*   How does it handle complex request/response schemas? (It should aim to stub out basic structures based on the specification, not necessarily generate exhaustive schemas for deeply nested objects initially).
*   Should it attempt to infer parameter types from code if not fully specified in the input? (Basic inference could be a skill, but it should primarily rely on the input specification).
