# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode is responsible for writing the code that directly interacts with the database to fetch, create, update, or delete data.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-backend-implementer` including:
        *   Specific data access requirements (e.g., "fetch user by ID," "create new product record," "find all orders matching criteria") often derived from `backend_feature_specification_v1.md`.
        *   Database schema information (ORM models or DDL).
        *   The chosen database type and ORM/query language.
        *   Path to the project codebase.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for framework/ORM/database-specific syntax and best practices for querying.
    *   Write functions, methods, or queries within the appropriate data access layer files (e.g., repositories, services that directly use the ORM) to fulfill the specified requirements.
    *   Implement logic for:
        *   Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
        *   Filtering, sorting, and pagination of data.
        *   Joining related data (if applicable for relational DBs).
        *   Aggregations (e.g., count, sum, average).
    *   Ensure queries are written efficiently (at a basic level) and securely (e.g., avoiding SQL injection if writing raw SQL, though ORMs largely handle this).
    *   Handle mapping of database results to application-level data structures or objects if necessary.
    *   Implement basic transaction management for operations that require atomicity (e.g., creating multiple related records).
    *   Write clean, maintainable, and well-commented data access code.
    *   Report the list of implemented/modified data access functions/files.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Framework-specific or plain language code files (e.g., `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.rb`) containing data access logic.
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** Functional and reasonably efficient code for interacting with the database according to specified requirements and the defined schema.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[5] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML. One per DB/ORM for common operations.)*
        *   `performing_crud_with_django_orm.md`
        *   `complex_select_queries_with_prisma.md`
        *   `mongodb_find_and_update_mongoose.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[3] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (Specifies what data operations are needed).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (The schema it will be querying against).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (To know which database type, ORM, and KB procedures to use).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[3] }}` (The codebase to add/modify data access logic).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: The business logic layer will use the functions/methods created by this mode to interact with the database.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Tests for business logic will indirectly test this data access layer, or specific tests might target these data access components.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `generic-database-query-writer` must emphasize its KB-driven ability to write data access code for various specified database systems and ORMs.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Web App Backend Implementation Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Source code files containing data access logic (queries, CRUD operations) for a specified database/ORM."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (generates/modifies framework-specific or plain language code files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-backend-implementer"`
*   It will heavily use file creation/editing tools and its KB for database/ORM-specific query syntax and patterns.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   How does it handle complex joins or aggregations that might require optimization? (Initially, it would implement them based on requirements; optimization might be a separate, more advanced task or mode).
*   What's its role in defining or using data transfer objects (DTOs) if the project uses them? (It would likely consume DTO definitions for request/response mapping if provided by `backend-requirements-analyzer` or `generic-business-logic-implementer`).
*   How deeply should it be involved in transaction management beyond basic atomicity for a single operation? (Complex, multi-step transactions might be orchestrated by the `generic-business-logic-implementer` which then calls individual query methods from this mode).
