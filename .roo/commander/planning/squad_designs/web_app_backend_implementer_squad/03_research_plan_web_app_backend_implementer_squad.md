# Squad Knowledge & Research Plan: {{ squad_unit_name_ref }}

## 1. Overview & Purpose üéØ

*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To identify the key knowledge domains and specific information required for the `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}` to effectively design, implement, and test backend features for web applications. This plan outlines internal resources, external research strategies (including MCP tool usage), and initial KB structuring ideas for squad members.
*   **Overall Knowledge Goal:** `{{ overall_knowledge_goal }}`
*   **Research Coordination:** `{{ research_coordinator_proposed }}` will oversee the execution of research tasks, likely by assigning MDTM tasks to `meta-kb-editor` or a specialized `agent-research` mode.

## 2. Key Knowledge Domains & Requirements üß†

## 3. Information Gathering & Research Strategy (General Approach) üîç

For each specific technology (framework, database, ORM, testing tool, auth provider) that the `manager-web-app-backend-implementer` decides to support (based on user needs or common usage):

*   **Targeted For:** The KB of the relevant generic specialist(s) (e.g., `generic-api-endpoint-developer/kb/skills/expressjs_routing.md`).
*   **Internal Sources Review:**
    *   Review existing Roo Commander standards (e.g., for security, error handling) that apply.
    *   If similar functionality exists in other projects within the workspace, analyze those for patterns (Repomix could assist here if code is available).
*   **External Research Plan (MCP & Manual):**
    *   **Key Questions for Research (Example for a new framework "X"):**
        *   "Official installation and setup guide for framework X."
        *   "Best practices for API routing in framework X."
        *   "Common ORM/data access patterns for framework X with [DB Type]."
        *   "Unit testing conventions for framework X."
        *   "Authentication middleware patterns for framework X."
    *   **Suggested MCP Tools & Queries:**
        *   `[Tool: vertex-ai-mcp-server/answer_query_websearch]` - Query: `"framework X official documentation"`, `"framework X tutorial API development"`
        *   `[Tool: fetch-mcp/get_url_content]` - URL: Official docs, key tutorials, GitHub repos.
        *   `[Tool: crawl4ai-mcp/crawl_website]` - Target: Official documentation site for framework X. Scope: Core API, database, testing sections.
*   **Expected Output of this Research (per technology):**
    *   A set of new `skills/` articles for the relevant generic specialists' KBs.
    *   Potentially `wisdom/` articles on best practices or common pitfalls for that technology.
    *   `reference/` articles for quick lookups (e.g., common CLI commands, config snippets).

## 4. Proposed Knowledge Base (KB) Structure for the Squad üèóÔ∏è

*   **`manager-web-app-backend-implementer`/kb/:**
    *   `procedures/01-main-backend-feature-orchestration.md` (details the flow using this squad).
    *   `reference/00-backend-implementer-squad-composition.md`.
    *   `skills/`: "Coordinating API and Business Logic Development", "Managing Database Migration Handoffs".
    *   `wisdom/`: "Principles of Testable Backend Design", "Iterative Backend Feature Development".
*   **`backend-requirements-analyzer`/kb/:** (Skills/Wisdom from Domain 1 above)
*   **`generic-api-endpoint-developer`/kb/:** (Skills/Wisdom from Domain 2, organized by framework)
*   **`generic-business-logic-implementer`/kb/:** (Skills/Wisdom from Domain 3, organized by language/pattern)
*   **`generic-database-schema-modifier`/kb/:** (Skills/Wisdom from Domain 4, organized by DB/ORM)
*   **`generic-database-query-writer`/kb/:** (Skills/Wisdom from Domain 5, organized by DB/ORM)
*   **`backend-auth-enforcer`/kb/:** (Skills/Wisdom from Domain 6, organized by framework/auth provider)
*   **`backend-test-writer`/kb/:** (Skills/Wisdom from Domain 7, organized by framework/testing tool)
*   **`api-documentation-stubber`/kb/:** (Skills/Wisdom from Domain 8, organized by doc format/tool)

## 5. Research Execution & Coordination üöÄ

*   **Responsibility:** `{{ research_coordinator_proposed }}` will assign MDTM tasks to `meta-kb-editor` (or `agent-research`) to research each required technology/framework and populate the KBs of the respective generic specialists.
*   **Timeline (Conceptual):** Foundational KB articles for 1-2 core backend stacks (e.g., Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL/Prisma, Python/Django + PostgreSQL/DjangoORM) should be prioritized before the squad is considered fully operational for those stacks. Support for other stacks can be added iteratively.
*   **Deliverables:** A growing library of well-structured, actionable KB articles within each specialist mode's KB, enabling them to perform their "generic" role across multiple technologies.

This plan will guide the foundational knowledge acquisition for the `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`, making it a versatile and powerful unit for backend development.
