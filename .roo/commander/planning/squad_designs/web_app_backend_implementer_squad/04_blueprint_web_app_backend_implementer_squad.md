*   **Total Squad Members Proposed:** `{{ number_of_squad_members }}`

## 5. Workflow & Artifact Flow Overview üîÑ

The squad typically operates in a sequence starting with requirements analysis, followed by parallel or sequential development of API endpoints, business logic, and database components. Authentication is layered on, and testing/documentation occurs throughout or towards the end of feature implementation. The `manager-web-app-backend-implementer` orchestrates this flow, ensuring artifacts like the `backend_feature_specification_v1.md` drive subsequent development, and that code from different specialists integrates correctly.

**Visual Flow (Refer to detailed diagram in `{{ linked_workflow_doc }}`):**
```mermaid
graph TD
    FeatureReq["Feature Requirements (MDTM to Mgr)"] --> Mgr["manager-web-app-backend-implementer"];
    subgraph BackendImplementationSquadWorkflow
        Mgr -- Task1 --> ReqA["backend-requirements-analyzer"];
        ReqA -- backend_feature_spec.md --> Mgr;

        APIDev & AuthE --> APIDoc;
    end
    Mgr -- Implemented Backend Feature --> FinalOutput["Updated Project Codebase"];```

## 6. Key Knowledge & Research Requirements Summary üìö

The squad's "generic" specialists (`generic-api-endpoint-developer`, `generic-business-logic-implementer`, `generic-database-schema-modifier`, `generic-database-query-writer`) require extensive, framework/database-specific knowledge in their KBs.
*   **Primary Research Focus Areas:**
    *   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[0] }}` (Backend Requirements Analysis & Specification)
    *   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[1] }}` (API Endpoint Development for Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask, Ruby/Rails, etc.)
    *   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[2] }}` (Business Logic Patterns for various languages)
    *   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[3] }}` (Schema/Migration for PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB with ORMs like Prisma, SQLAlchemy, Mongoose, Django ORM, ActiveRecord)
    *   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[4] }}` (Querying for the above DBs/ORMs)
    *   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[5] }}` (Auth enforcement patterns for different frameworks with JWT, Clerk, Firebase Admin, etc.)
    *   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[6] }}` (Testing with Jest/Supertest, PyTest, RSpec, etc.)
    *   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[7] }}` (OpenAPI, JSDoc, TSDoc, Sphinx for API docs)
*   **Key MCP Tools Identified for Bootstrapping KB:** Web search (Vertex AI, Perplexity), content fetching (Fetch, Crawl4AI) for official documentation, tutorials, and best practices for each supported technology.

## 7. Proposed Next Steps for Development üõ†Ô∏è

1.  **Architectural Review and Approval:** Finalize and approve this Squad Design Blueprint.
2.  **Mode Definition (`.mode.md`):** Create `.mode.md` files for `manager-web-app-backend-implementer` and all 8 squad members, using archetype templates and details from the Role Definition documents.
3.  **Mode-Specific Rules (`[.roo/rules-[mode_slug]/]`):** Develop `00-[slug]-core-principles.md` for all modes. Develop `01-manager-web-app-backend-implementer-squad-orchestration.md` for the Manager.
4.  **Initial KB Scaffolding & Population:**
    *   Create `kb/README.md` for all modes.
    *   For `manager-web-app-backend-implementer`, create `kb/procedures/01-main-backend-feature-orchestration.md` and `kb/reference/00-backend-implementer-squad-composition.md`.
    *   Begin populating KBs for generic specialists with procedures/skills for 1-2 initial target backend stacks (e.g., Node.js/Express + PostgreSQL/Prisma) based on the Research Plan. This will be an ongoing task for `meta-kb-editor`.
5.  **Integration with Orchestrator:** Update `üëë Roo Commander`'s KB to make `manager-web-app-backend-implementer` available.
6.  **Iterative Testing:** Develop and test the squad's capabilities, starting with a simple feature implementation on a supported stack.

This blueprint provides a comprehensive plan for developing the `{{ squad_unit_name }}`.
