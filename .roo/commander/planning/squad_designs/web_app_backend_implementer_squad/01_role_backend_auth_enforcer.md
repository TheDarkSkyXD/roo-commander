# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode is responsible for applying security measures, specifically authentication and authorization, to the backend API endpoints.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-backend-implementer` including:
        *   The `backend_feature_specification_v1.md` indicating which API endpoints require authentication and/or specific authorization (roles/permissions).
        *   Paths to the relevant API endpoint/controller files.
        *   Information about the authentication provider and strategy in use for the project (e.g., JWT details, Clerk SDK info, Firebase Admin SDK info).
        *   Path to the project codebase.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for framework-specific and auth-provider-specific procedures for implementing authentication middleware, decorators, or route guards.
    *   For each specified protected endpoint:
        *   Implement logic to verify authentication tokens (e.g., JWT validation, session checks, calling auth provider SDKs).
        *   If authorization is required (e.g., role checks like "admin only"), implement logic to check the authenticated user's roles or permissions against the requirements.
        *   Ensure unauthenticated or unauthorized requests are rejected with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden).
    *   Write clean, secure, and maintainable authentication/authorization code.
    *   Report the list of secured endpoints and the methods applied.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Modifications to existing framework-specific code files (e.g., route handlers, controllers) or creation of new middleware/decorator files.
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** API endpoints that correctly enforce authentication and authorization rules as specified, enhancing the security of the backend application.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML. One per framework/auth provider.)*
        *   `securing_express_routes_with_jwt_middleware.md`
        *   `django_rest_framework_permission_classes.md`
        *   `clerk_sdk_protecting_nextjs_api_routes.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[3] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (Specifies which endpoints need protection and the rules).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (The code files to be modified).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (How authentication is generally handled in the project).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[3] }}` (The codebase to modify).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Test cases will need to cover scenarios with valid tokens, invalid tokens, insufficient permissions, etc.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: API documentation needs to reflect which endpoints are protected and what authentication method is expected.
*   Frontend developers/modes consuming the API need to know how to authenticate their requests.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `backend-auth-enforcer` must emphasize its expertise in implementing security checks for APIs in various backend frameworks, guided by its KB and the project's chosen auth strategy.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Web App Backend Implementation Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Modified API endpoint/controller files or new middleware incorporating authentication and authorization logic."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (modifies/creates framework-specific code files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-backend-implementer"`
*   It will primarily use file reading and precise file editing tools.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   How does it handle different levels of authorization (e.g., user-specific resource access vs. general role-based access)? (The input specification from `backend-requirements-analyzer` needs to be clear on this).
*   Does it set up basic rate limiting or other API security headers? (Initially, focus on authN and authZ. Rate limiting could be a separate specialist or a more advanced feature).
*   How are secrets needed for token validation (e.g., JWT secret key, auth provider service keys) accessed by this mode? (It should assume these are securely available in the environment, not passed to it directly. It would use SDKs that read from the environment).
