# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode is responsible for the actual coding of API endpoints based on provided specifications.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-backend-implementer` including:
        *   The `backend_feature_specification_v1.md` detailing API endpoint contracts (paths, methods, request/response schemas).
        *   The chosen backend framework.
        *   Path to the project codebase.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for framework-specific procedures for creating API endpoints.
    *   For each specified endpoint:
        *   Create or modify route handler files/controller methods.
        *   Implement request parsing (e.g., for query parameters, request bodies).
        *   Perform basic input validation (e.g., checking for required fields, basic data types).
        *   Call appropriate service layer functions or business logic modules (to be implemented by `generic-business-logic-implementer`) to handle the core processing.
        *   Format and send appropriate HTTP responses (success data, error messages with correct status codes).
    *   Ensure created endpoints adhere to RESTful principles or GraphQL best practices as applicable.
    *   Write clean, maintainable code according to project coding standards.
    *   Report the list of implemented/modified endpoint files.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Framework-specific code files (e.g., `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.rb`).
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** Functional API endpoints that correctly handle requests, delegate to business logic, and return appropriate responses according to the specification.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[5] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML. One per framework.)*
        *   `implementing_express_routes_controllers.md`
        *   `implementing_django_rest_viewsets.md`
        *   `handling_json_requests_responses_flask.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (This is the primary specification for its work).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (To know which framework's conventions and KB procedures to use).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (The codebase to modify/add to).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: The business logic implementer will provide the services these endpoints call. There's a tight coupling here; often, the API endpoint developer might also stub out the service calls.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Will add security layers to these endpoints.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: Will test these endpoints.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[3] }}`: Will generate documentation for these endpoints.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[4] }}`: Will consume these APIs.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `generic-api-endpoint-developer` must emphasize its KB-driven ability to implement API endpoints in various specified backend frameworks.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Web App Backend Implementation Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Implemented API endpoint source code files for a specified backend framework."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (generates/modifies framework-specific code files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-backend-implementer"`
*   It will heavily use file creation/editing tools and its KB for framework-specific API patterns.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   How much initial data validation should this mode perform versus deferring to a dedicated validation layer within the business logic? (Basic validation like required fields and types seems appropriate for the endpoint layer).
*   How does it handle API versioning if specified in the requirements? (Initially, it might focus on implementing v1 and add comments for future versioning considerations).
*   Does it stub out calls to the business logic layer if those components aren't implemented yet? (Yes, this would be good practice, e.g., `// TODO: Call userService.getUser(id)`).
