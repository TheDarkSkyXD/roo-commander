# Planning Documents: Workspace Maintenance Squad

## Purpose of this Directory

This directory contains the set of planning and design documents that collectively define the **Workspace Maintenance Squad**, a specialized "Manager + Squad" unit within the Roo Commander V8 ecosystem. This squad, orchestrated by the `manager-workspace-maintenance` mode, is responsible for the setup, ongoing maintenance, quality assurance, and systematic evolution of the Roo Commander V8 workspace itself.

The documents herein were created using the standard "Squad Planning & Design" templates located in `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/)`.

## Key Planning Documents in this Directory:

1.  **`00-concept-mission-workspace-maintenance-squad.md`**
    *   Defines the overall mission, purpose, value proposition, and strategic alignment of the Workspace Maintenance Squad.

2.  **Role Definitions (`01-role-*.md` files):**
    *   `01-role-architect-squad-designer.md`
    *   `01-role-devops-dependency-manager.md`
    *   `01-role-infra-mcp-setup-specialist.md`
    *   `01-role-meta-kb-editor.md`
    *   `01-role-meta-mode-developer.md`
    *   `01-role-meta-workflow-integrator.md`
    *   `01-role-release-process-assistant.md`
    *   `01-role-standards-guardian.md`
    *   `01-role-symbolic-language-refactor-agent.md`
    *   `01-role-system-documentation-updater.md`
    *   Each file details the specific responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for one member of the Workspace Maintenance Squad.

3.  **`02-workflow-artifact-flow-workspace-maintenance-squad.md`**
    *   Maps out the typical service flows orchestrated by `manager-workspace-maintenance` and how its squad members interact, including the flow of key artifacts.

4.  **`03-knowledge-research-plan-workspace-maintenance-squad.md`**
    *   Identifies key knowledge domains required by the squad and outlines plans for acquiring this knowledge, including bootstrapping their KBs.

5.  **`04-blueprint-workspace-maintenance-squad.md` (To Be Created)**
    *   This document will serve as the consolidated summary and final blueprint for the Workspace Maintenance Squad, synthesizing information from all the documents listed above. It will guide the actual development of the `manager-workspace-maintenance` mode and its 10 squad members.

## Next Steps After Planning

Once the `04-blueprint-workspace-maintenance-squad.md` is completed and approved, the next phase involves:
*   Creating the actual `.mode.md` definition files for `manager-workspace-maintenance` and each of its squad members.
*   Developing their mode-specific rules (`rules-[mode_slug]/`).
*   Populating their initial Knowledge Bases (`kb/`).
*   Integrating `manager-workspace-maintenance` into `roo-commander`'s list of available managers.

These planning documents provide the foundational design for this critical system-support squad.
