## 3. Information Gathering & Research Strategy üîç

*(This section outlines general strategies. Specific research tasks would be delegated by `manager-workspace-maintenance` to squad members or `agent-research` if available).*

### 3.1. Information/Skill: Understanding RCv8 Standards & Architecture (for all relevant squad members)

*   **Targeted For:** All Workspace Maintenance Squad members.
*   **Internal Sources Review:**
    *   **MANDATORY:** All files within `[.roo/rules/](.roo/rules/)` and `[.roo/commander/docs/standards/](.roo/commander/docs/standards/)`.
    *   Key architectural documents in `[.roo/commander/docs/architecture/](.roo/commander/docs/architecture/)`.
    *   All template READMEs in `[.roo/commander/templates/](.roo/commander/templates/)`.
*   **User-Provided Context:** N/A (this is about the system itself).
*   **External Research Plan:** Generally not needed for internal standards, but for underlying concepts (e.g., "best practices for TOML," "Markdown Guide"), general web search MCPs can be used if a mode needs to deepen its understanding.
*   **Expected Output of this Research:** Deep familiarity, ability to apply standards in their work. This knowledge will primarily be tested through their task performance rather than creating new summary documents.

### 3.2. Information/Skill: Docker Desktop & Specific MCP Server Setup (for `infra-mcp-setup-specialist`)

*   **Targeted For:** `infra-mcp-setup-specialist`'s KB (`skills/` and `reference/`).
*   **Internal Sources Review:** Any existing notes or scripts in `[.roo/commander/mcp-servers/](.roo/commander/mcp-servers/)`.
*   **External Research Plan (MCP & Manual):**
    *   **Key Questions for Research:**
        *   "Latest official installation instructions for Docker Desktop on Windows/macOS/Linux."
        *   "Official Docker Hub image and `docker run` command for [Specific MCP Server, e.g., Ollama]."
        *   "Common troubleshooting steps for Docker Desktop [OS] not starting."
    *   **Suggested MCP Tools & Queries:**
        *   `[Tool: vertex-ai-mcp-server/answer_query_websearch]` - Query: `"install docker desktop windows official"`
        *   `[Tool: fetch-mcp/get_url_content]` - URL: `[Official Docker documentation pages, Official MCP server GitHub/DockerHub pages]`
*   **Expected Output of this Research:** Draft KB articles for `infra-mcp-setup-specialist` like `kb/skills/01-installing-docker-desktop-windows.md`, etc.

### 3.3. Information/Skill: NPM Best Practices (for `devops-dependency-manager`)

*   **Targeted For:** `devops-dependency-manager`'s KB (`skills/` and `wisdom/`).
*   **External Research Plan (MCP & Manual):**
    *   **Key Questions for Research:**
        *   "Best practices for `npm update` vs `npm install <package>@latest`."
        *   "Common causes and solutions for NPM ERESOLVE errors."
        *   "How to effectively use `npm audit fix`."
    *   **Suggested MCP Tools & Queries:**
        *   `[Tool: vertex-ai-mcp-server/answer_query_websearch]` - Query: `"npm best practices dependency management"`
        *   `[Tool: fetch-mcp/get_url_content]` - URL: `[Official NPM documentation, reputable Node.js blogs]`
*   **Expected Output of this Research:** Draft KB articles for `devops-dependency-manager` like `kb/skills/03-resolving-common-npm-dependency-conflicts.md`.

*(Similar research plans would be outlined for Git/GitHub releases, Symbolic Language details once available, and technical writing principles, targeting the respective squad members' KBs.)*

## 4. Proposed Knowledge Base (KB) Structure for the Squad

*   Each squad member (`infra-mcp-setup-specialist`, `devops-dependency-manager`, `architect-squad-designer`, `meta-mode-developer`, `meta-kb-editor`, `meta-workflow-integrator`, `standards-guardian`, `system-documentation-updater`, `release-process-assistant`, `symbolic-language-refactor-agent`) will have its own KB.
*   The initial focus for populating these KBs will be:
    *   **`infra-mcp-setup-specialist`:** `skills/` on Docker and specific MCPs.
    *   **`devops-dependency-manager`:** `skills/` on NPM.
    *   **`architect-squad-designer`:** `skills/` on using each planning template, `wisdom/` on good squad design.
    *   **`meta-mode-developer`:** `skills/` on scaffolding each mode archetype, `reference/` to all mode/rule/KB templates.
    *   **`meta-kb-editor`:** `skills/` on using KB article templates, `wisdom/` on writing for AI.
    *   **`meta-workflow-integrator`:** `skills/` on editing `roo-commander`'s specific KB/config files.
    *   **`standards-guardian`:** `skills/` on auditing against each major standard/rule, `reference/` to all standards/rules.
    *   **`system-documentation-updater`:** `skills/` on writing different guide types, `reference/` to documentation templates.
    *   **`release-process-assistant`:** `skills/` on each step of the release SOP, `reference/` to the SOP itself.
    *   **`symbolic-language-refactor-agent`:** `skills/` on applying symbols, `reference/` to the glossary.

## 5. Research Execution & Coordination

*   **Responsibility:** `manager-workspace-maintenance` will create MDTM tasks for specific squad members (or `agent-research` if that mode is available and suitable) to perform targeted research and draft initial KB articles based on this plan.
*   **Timeline (Conceptual):** KB bootstrapping for core functions should occur before a squad member is considered fully operational for complex tasks.
*   **Deliverables:** A set of foundational KB articles for each Workspace Maintenance Squad member.

This plan will guide the foundational knowledge acquisition and KB development for the `Workspace Maintenance Squad`, enabling its members to perform their specialized system upkeep and evolution tasks effectively.
