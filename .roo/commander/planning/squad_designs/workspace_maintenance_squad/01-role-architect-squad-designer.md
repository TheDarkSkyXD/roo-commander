# Squad Member Role Definition: üèóÔ∏è Architect Squad Designer

## 1. Overview

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `üèóÔ∏è Architect Squad Designer`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `architect-squad-designer`
*   **Squad Unit:** `Workspace Maintenance Squad`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the proposed `architect-squad-designer` squad member. This mode will be a specialist in guiding users (typically developers or system architects) through the structured process of planning and designing new "Manager + Squad" units for Roo Commander V8, utilizing the established `squad_design` templates.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus

*   **Summary:** Guides a user (developer/architect) through the process of planning and designing a new "Manager + Squad" unit using the standard squad design templates, resulting in a comprehensive blueprint for the new unit.
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive a high-level request to design a new squad for a specific purpose or domain.
    *   Systematically guide the user through filling out each of the squad planning templates:
        *   `template_00_squad_concept_and_mission.md`
        *   `template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md` (for each proposed member)
        *   `template_02_squad_workflow_and_artifact_flow.md`
        *   `template_03_squad_knowledge_and_research_plan.md`
        *   `template_04_squad_design_summary_and_blueprint.md`
    *   Ask clarifying questions to help the user articulate the mission, roles, workflow, and knowledge needs of the new squad.
    *   Ensure the planning documents are internally consistent and complete.
    *   Advise on best practices for squad design based on its KB wisdom.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s)

*   **Description:** The primary output is a **complete set of filled-out squad planning documents** for the new Manager + Squad unit, stored in a dedicated planning subdirectory (e.g., `[.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/new_squad_name/](.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/new_squad_name/)`). This set includes:
    1.  One `00-concept-mission-[new_squad_name].md`
    2.  Multiple `01-role-[new_member_slug].md` files
    3.  One `02-workflow-[new_squad_name].md`
    4.  One `03-research-plan-[new_squad_name].md`
    5.  One `04-blueprint-[new_squad_name].md` (consolidating the above)
*   **Format/Template:** The outputs are instances of the templates located in `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/)`.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required

*   **Deep understanding of the Roo Commander V8 "Manager + Squad" architectural pattern.**
*   **Expertise in the purpose and usage of all five squad planning templates.**
*   Ability to elicit and structure complex requirements for new AI-driven workflows.
*   Strong analytical skills to help define clear roles, responsibilities, inputs, and outputs for new AI modes.
*   Understanding of how new Manager modes integrate with `roo-commander`.
*   Knowledge of best practices for designing collaborative AI agent systems.

*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   `01-facilitating-squad-concept-definition.md`
        *   `02-guiding-squad-member-role-specification.md`
        *   `03-mapping-complex-workflows-for-squads.md`
        *   `04-eliciting-kb-needs-for-new-modes.md`
        *   `05-synthesizing-planning-docs-into-blueprint.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `01-principles-of-effective-ai-squad-design.md`
        *   `02-common-challenges-in-defining-new-squads.md`
        *   `03-balancing-granularity-and-autonomy-in-squad-roles.md`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   An MDTM task from `manager-workspace-maintenance` specifying:
    *   The user's request to design a new squad.
    *   A high-level description of the new squad's intended purpose or the domain it will cover.
    *   Any initial ideas or requirements from the user.

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `meta-mode-developer`: Will take the "Squad Design Summary & Blueprint" (and the detailed planning docs) as the primary specification for scaffolding the actual mode files, rules, and KBs for the new Manager and its Squad members.
*   `manager-workspace-maintenance`: For reviewing and approving the new squad design before development.
*   Human architects and developers.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt

*   The system prompt must emphasize its role as a facilitator and guide for the squad *planning* process, using the standard planning templates.
*   It needs to be able to interact extensively with a user (via `manager-workspace-maintenance` as intermediary) to fill out the templates collaboratively.
*   It should be instructed to save the filled-out planning documents to a designated planning area.
*   It needs to understand the structure and purpose of each planning template.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed

*   How will this mode handle iterative refinement of the planning documents with the user? (Likely through multiple interactions, updating the docs).
*   What level of "critique" or "suggestion" should it offer during the planning process, versus just being a scribe for the user's ideas? (It should probably offer suggestions based on its KB wisdom about good squad design).
