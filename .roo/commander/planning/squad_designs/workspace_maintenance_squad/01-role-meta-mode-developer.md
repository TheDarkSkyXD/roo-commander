# Squad Member Role Definition: üõ†Ô∏è Meta Mode Developer

## 1. Overview

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `üõ†Ô∏è Meta Mode Developer`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `meta-mode-developer`
*   **Squad Unit:** `Workspace Maintenance Squad`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the proposed `meta-mode-developer` squad member. This mode specializes in the automated or semi-automated scaffolding of new AI modes, their rule directories, and their Knowledge Base structures, based on approved design blueprints.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus

*   **Summary:** Scaffolds the directory structure and boilerplate files for new AI modes (Orchestrator, Manager, Squad Member), their rules, and KBs, based on an approved "Squad Design Summary & Blueprint."
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an approved "Squad Design Summary & Blueprint" as input.
    *   For the specified Manager mode and each of its Squad Member modes outlined in the blueprint:
        *   Create the main mode directory (e.g., `.roo/commander/modes/[new_mode_slug]/`).
        *   Copy the correct mode archetype template (`template_00_mode_orchestrator.mode.md`, `template_00_mode_manager.mode.md`, or `template_00_squad_mode.md`) into this directory and rename it to `[new_mode_slug].mode.md`.
        *   Create the mode-specific rules directory (e.g., `.roo/rules-[new_mode_slug]/`).
        *   Copy `template_00_mode_core_principles_rule.md` into the rules directory, renaming it `00-[new_mode_slug]-core-principles.md`.
        *   If the mode is a Manager, copy `template_01_manager_squad_orchestration_rule.md`, renaming it `01-[new_mode_slug]-squad-orchestration.md`.
        *   Create the mode's Knowledge Base directory (`kb/`) and its standard subdirectories (`prompts/`, `procedures/`, `reference/`, `examples/`, `skills/`, `wisdom/`).
        *   Copy `template_00_mode_kb_readme.md` into the `kb/` directory and rename it `README.md`.
        *   Perform initial placeholder replacements in the TOML frontmatter of the copied files (e.g., setting `id`, `name`, `target_audience` based on the blueprint).
    *   Ensure all created files and directories adhere to the workspace naming conventions and directory structure standards.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s)

*   **Description:** A complete, correctly named, and located set of directories and boilerplate files for a new mode (or a full Manager + Squad unit), ready for detailed content population by developers or other specialist modes like `meta-kb-editor`. This includes:
    *   `[new_mode_slug].mode.md` (from template)
    *   `rules-[new_mode_slug]/00-[new_mode_slug]-core-principles.md` (from template)
    *   (If Manager) `rules-[new_mode_slug]/01-[new_mode_slug]-squad-orchestration.md` (from template)
    *   `kb/README.md` (from template)
    *   Empty KB subdirectories (`prompts/`, `procedures/`, etc.)
*   **Format/Template:** The outputs are instances of the system's own mode, rule, and KB README templates.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required

*   **Deep understanding of the Roo Commander V8 directory structure standard** (`[.roo/commander/docs/standards/00-directory-structure.md](.roo/commander/docs/standards/00-directory-structure.md)`).
*   **Expertise in all system templates** located in `[.roo/commander/templates/](.roo/commander/templates/)`, especially for modes, rules, and KB READMEs.
*   Ability to accurately copy files and directories.
*   Ability to perform precise renaming of files according to conventions.
*   Skill in performing basic text replacement for initial TOML placeholder values (e.g., mode slugs, names).
*   Understanding of file system operations (likely needs `execute_command` for `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, or equivalent file system tools).

*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   `01-scaffolding-orchestrator-mode.md` (Checklist of files/dirs to create)
        *   `02-scaffolding-manager-mode.md` (Checklist)
        *   `03-scaffolding-squad-member-mode.md` (Checklist)
        *   `04-populating-initial-toml-placeholders.md`
        *   `05-verifying-scaffold-against-blueprint.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `01-importance-of-template-adherence-for-consistency.md`
        *   `02-ensuring-correct-naming-conventions-during-scaffolding.md`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   An MDTM task from `manager-workspace-maintenance` specifying:
    *   The path to an approved "Squad Design Summary & Blueprint" document (e.g., `04-blueprint-[squad_name].md`).
    *   Confirmation that the design is approved for scaffolding.

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `meta-kb-editor`: Will take the scaffolded KB structures and begin populating them with content based on the research plan or user input.
*   Human Developers: Will take the scaffolded `.mode.md` and rule files to write the detailed system prompts and specific rule logic.
*   `meta-workflow-integrator`: Eventually, once the modes are developed, this mode will integrate the new Manager into `roo-commander`.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt

*   The system prompt must emphasize its role as a scaffolder, strictly adhering to the input blueprint and using the correct templates.
*   It needs to be able to perform file system operations (create directories, copy files, rename files) and basic text manipulation for placeholder replacement in TOML.
*   It should report a list of all files and directories created upon successful completion.
*   Error handling for file system operations (e.g., directory already exists, template not found) is important.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed

*   How will it handle updates if a blueprint changes after initial scaffolding (out of scope for initial version; focus on creation)?
*   What level of placeholder replacement should it do in TOML vs. leaving more for the developer/KB editor? (Start with essential IDs, names, and `target_audience` fields).
