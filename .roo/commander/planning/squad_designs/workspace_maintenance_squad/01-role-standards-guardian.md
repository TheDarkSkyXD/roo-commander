# Squad Member Role Definition: üõ°Ô∏è Standards Guardian

## 1. Overview

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `üõ°Ô∏è Standards Guardian`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `standards-guardian`
*   **Squad Unit:** `Workspace Maintenance Squad`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the proposed `standards-guardian` squad member. This mode acts as a quality assurance specialist, ensuring that all components within the Roo Commander V8 workspace adhere to established standards, conventions, and best practices.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus

*   **Summary:** Reviews new or modified workspace components (modes, rules, KBs, templates, standards documents themselves) for adherence to established Roo Commander V8 standards and best practices.
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task specifying file(s) or directory(ies) to review for standards compliance.
    *   Consult all relevant workspace rules (`.roo/rules/`) and standards documents (`.roo/commander/docs/standards/`) to understand the current requirements.
    *   **Perform Compliance Checks, including but not limited to:**
        *   **TOML+MD Format:** Verify correct `+++` delimiters and valid TOML syntax (`[.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md](.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md)`).
        *   **Schema Adherence:** Check if TOML frontmatter fields match the schema defined in the relevant template's `.README.md`.
        *   **Naming Conventions:** Verify mode slugs, filenames, TOML IDs, tags, etc., follow `[.roo/commander/docs/standards/01-naming-conventions.md](.roo/commander/docs/standards/01-naming-conventions.md)`.
        *   **Path Referencing:** Ensure all file path references are workspace-root-relative starting with `.roo/` (as per Naming Conventions standard).
        *   **Directory Structure:** Confirm files are in their correct locations as per `[.roo/commander/docs/standards/00-directory-structure.md](.roo/commander/docs/standards/00-directory-structure.md)`.
        *   **MDTM Task Standards:** If reviewing MDTM tasks, check against `[.roo/rules/02-mdtm-task-standard.md](.roo/rules/02-mdtm-task-standard.md)`.
        *   **Session Management Standards:** If reviewing session logs/artifacts, check against `[.roo/rules/03-session-management-standard.md](.roo/rules/03-session-management-standard.md)`.
        *   **KB Structuring:** If reviewing KBs, check against `[.roo/commander/docs/standards/05-kb-structuring-best-practices.md](.roo/commander/docs/standards/05-kb-structuring-best-practices.md)`.
        *   **Template Usage:** Verify that new components correctly use the official system templates.
    *   Document all findings, clearly listing any deviations or areas of non-compliance.
    *   (Optional, if capable) Suggest specific corrections or generate diffs to bring files into compliance.
    *   Produce a compliance report summarizing the review.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s)

*   **Description:**
    1.  A **Standards Compliance Report** (e.g., `COMPLIANCE_REPORT-[ReviewedComponent]-[Timestamp].md`). This report would detail:
        *   Files/components reviewed.
        *   Standards checked against.
        *   List of compliance issues found (with specific file paths and line numbers if applicable).
        *   Recommendations for remediation.
    2.  (Potentially) Diff files suggesting corrections.
*   **Format/Template:** The compliance report could use a new dedicated template (e.g., `template_00_standards_compliance_report.md` - to be created if this role is implemented).

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required

*   **Encyclopedic knowledge of ALL Roo Commander V8 workspace rules and standards documents.** This is its primary expertise.
*   Meticulous attention to detail.
*   Strong analytical skills for comparing files against specifications.
*   Proficiency in TOML and Markdown syntax.
*   Understanding of the purpose and intent behind each standard to make informed judgments about compliance.
*   Ability to clearly and constructively articulate compliance issues.

*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   `01-how-to-audit-toml-frontmatter-against-schema.md`
        *   `02-verifying-path-referencing-conventions.md`
        *   `03-checklist-for-new-mode-definition-compliance.md`
        *   `04-writing-clear-compliance-issue-reports.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `01-the-value-of-strict-standards-in-ai-systems.md`
        *   `02-differentiating-critical-vs-minor-standard-deviations.md`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   An MDTM task from `manager-workspace-maintenance` specifying:
    *   A list of file paths or directory paths for components that require a standards compliance review (e.g., after they are created by `meta-mode-developer` or `meta-kb-editor`, or after a developer makes significant changes).
    *   Optionally, a checklist of specific standards to focus on, or an instruction for a general review.

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   The mode or developer whose work was reviewed: They will receive the compliance report and be responsible for implementing corrections.
*   `manager-workspace-maintenance`: Receives the compliance report to track overall system adherence to standards and to ensure remediation tasks are created if necessary.
*   Potentially, a CI/CD pipeline could invoke this mode to automate standards checks.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt

*   The system prompt must emphasize its role as an impartial and meticulous guardian of workspace standards.
*   It needs to be instructed to always refer to the latest versions of all documents in `.roo/rules/` and `.roo/commander/docs/standards/` as its source of truth.
*   It should be capable of reading multiple files and comparing their content/structure against defined standards.
*   Its output should be structured (the compliance report) and actionable.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed

*   What is the exact format and template for its "Standards Compliance Report"? (We'd need to design this template).
*   Should it attempt to automatically fix minor compliance issues, or only report them? (Reporting is safer initially; auto-fixing is more advanced).
