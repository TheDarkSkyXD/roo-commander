# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode specializes in setting up and configuring the Firebase Authentication SDKs in both frontend and backend parts of an application.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-auth-integrator` including:
        *   The `auth_implementation_plan_v1.md` confirming Firebase Auth as the provider.
        *   Firebase project configuration details (API key, authDomain, etc.).
        *   Paths to the relevant frontend and backend project directories.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for Firebase SDK integration procedures specific to the project's frameworks.
    *   **Frontend Integration:**
        *   Install the Firebase client-side SDK (`firebase` npm package or script include).
        *   Initialize the Firebase app in the frontend codebase with the provided project configuration (e.g., in `firebase.js` or main app entry point).
        *   Set up a basic auth state listener (e.g., `onAuthStateChanged`) to demonstrate how to track user login status.
        *   Provide examples or stubs for accessing the current user object.
    *   **Backend Integration (if applicable):**
        *   Install the Firebase Admin SDK (e.g., `firebase-admin` npm package).
        *   Initialize the Firebase Admin app with appropriate service account credentials (guiding the user on secure handling if needed, or assuming credentials are in a secure environment variable).
        *   Provide example stubs or utility functions for verifying Firebase ID tokens received from the frontend.
    *   Update/create `.env.example` files with placeholders for Firebase configuration variables (e.g., `FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` path for backend).
    *   Report the files modified/created and confirm SDK initialization.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Modifications to existing code files (e.g., `main.js`, `App.jsx`, server startup files) and potentially new configuration files (e.g., `firebaseConfig.js`). Updates to `.env.example`.
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** The application codebase will have the Firebase Authentication SDKs correctly installed, initialized, and ready for other specialists to build UI flows and protection logic upon.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[5] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML.)*
        *   `firebase_client_sdk_setup_nextjs.md`
        *   `firebase_admin_sdk_setup_expressjs.md`
        *   `verifying_firebase_id_tokens_nodejs_backend.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[3] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (Confirms Firebase Auth is the choice and details flows).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (Crucial for SDK setup).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (Codebases to modify).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[3] }}` (To apply framework-specific integration patterns).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Will build UI components (login forms, user buttons) that use the initialized Firebase client SDK.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Will use the Firebase auth state (e.g., `currentUser`) from the client SDK to protect frontend routes.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: Will use the Firebase Admin SDK (or token verification logic) to protect backend API endpoints.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[3] }}`: Will build session management logic on top of Firebase's built-in session handling.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[4] }}`: Will write tests for flows that depend on Firebase Auth being integrated.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `firebase-auth-sdk-integrator` must emphasize its specific expertise in Firebase Authentication, covering both client and admin SDK setup and core functionalities, guided by its KB.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Authentication Integration Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Integrated Firebase Authentication SDKs (client & admin) with initial configuration and basic usage stubs."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (modifies code and .env.example files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-auth-integrator"`
*   It will use file editing tools and potentially `execute_command` for installing Firebase SDKs via package managers.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   How are Firebase project credentials (especially service account keys for Admin SDK) securely provided or handled? (This mode should guide the user to set them as environment variables and update `.env.example`, not handle raw keys itself).
*   Does it set up basic Firebase Security Rules stubs for Firestore/Realtime Database if those are also part of the project stack? (Initially, probably focus only on Auth setup. Database rules could be a separate concern or handled by a BaaS data integrator).
*   How does it handle different Firebase Auth features like email link sign-in, phone auth, etc., if requested in the plan? (Its KB would need specific skills for these; initial version might focus on common email/password and social provider setup).
