# Squad Concept & Mission: {{ squad_unit_name }}

## 1. Overview & Purpose üéØ

*   **Squad Unit Name:** `{{ squad_unit_name }}`
*   **Proposed Managing Mode:** `{{ proposed_managing_mode_name }}` (`{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}`)
*   **Primary Domain Focus:** `{{ primary_domain_focus }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the foundational concept, mission, strategic alignment, and value proposition for the proposed `{{ squad_unit_name }}`. This unit will specialize in adding robust authentication and authorization layers to web applications.

## 2. Mission Statement üöÄ

The mission of the `{{ squad_unit_name }}`, orchestrated by the `{{ proposed_managing_mode_name }}`, is to provide a secure, reliable, and efficient AI-assisted service for integrating chosen authentication providers (like Clerk, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth) or implementing custom JWT solutions into web applications, covering all necessary frontend and backend components.

## 3. Problem/Opportunity Addressed ü§î

*   **User/System Problem Solved:** `{{ solves_specific_user_problem }}` Implementing authentication correctly is often time-consuming, error-prone, and has significant security implications. Many developers struggle with the nuances of different providers or secure custom implementations.
*   **Opportunity:** To offer a standardized, AI-guided approach to a critical aspect of web development, ensuring that applications built or augmented with Roo Commander have a solid security foundation for user management from the outset.

## 4. Core Capabilities of the Unit ‚ú®

The `{{ squad_unit_name }}` will, through its specialist members, be capable of:
*   Analyzing project requirements to define specific authentication and authorization needs (e.g., provider choice, user flows, protected resources).
*   Integrating and configuring SDKs for various auth providers (Clerk, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth).
*   Implementing custom JWT-based authentication systems if required.
*   Building frontend UI components for login, signup, logout, user profiles, and other auth-related flows.
*   Securing frontend routes based on authentication status and user roles/permissions.
*   Securing backend API endpoints by validating tokens and checking permissions.
*   Managing user sessions securely.
*   Writing comprehensive tests for all authentication and authorization logic.

## 5. Target Users / Beneficiaries üë•

*   `{{ key_stakeholders_or_beneficiaries | join: "; " }}`.
*   Any project requiring user accounts and secure access to its features or data.

## 6. Strategic Alignment üîó

*   `{{ aligns_with_overall_system_goal }}`
*   This squad can be invoked by `üëë Roo Commander` directly for a new project, or by other managers like `manager-web-app-scaffolder` (to add auth to a scaffold) or `manager-web-app-frontend/backend-implementer` (to add auth to specific features).

## 7. Value Proposition & Key Outputs üåü

*   **Primary Value Proposition:** `{{ primary_value_proposition }}`
*   **Target Primary Output of the Unit:** `{{ target_primary_output_of_unit }}`
    *   This includes modifications to frontend code, backend code, new configuration files, and new test files.

## 8. High-Level Success Metrics for the Unit üìà

*   *(Corresponds to `key_success_metrics_for_unit` in TOML)*
    *   Successful and secure integration of the chosen authentication provider/strategy.
    *   Correct functionality of user authentication flows (signup, login, logout, session management).
    *   Effective protection of specified frontend routes and backend API endpoints.
    *   Quality and coverage of tests for authentication and authorization logic.
    *   Clarity of integration and ease for developers to build upon the auth setup.

## 9. Initial Assumptions & Dependencies (Conceptual) üìù

*   **Key Assumptions:**
    *   AI modes can be effectively specialized for different auth providers and for frontend vs. backend auth tasks.
    *   Clear requirements for auth flows and protected resources can be provided or elicited.
    *   The target application (scaffolded or existing) has a known structure where auth components can be integrated.
*   **Potential Dependencies:**
    *   Requires a defined frontend and/or backend tech stack for the target application.
    *   May need access to API keys or provider-specific configuration details (securely managed, not passed directly to modes if possible, but configured in `.env` or similar by `agent-mcp-manager` or user).
    *   Relies on `meta-kb-editor` for building out the KBs for various auth providers and integration patterns.

## 10. Next Steps in Squad Design ‚û°Ô∏è

*   Define individual Squad Member Roles for the `{{ squad_unit_name }}` (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md]`). This will include roles like `auth-requirements-specifier`, `clerk-sdk-integrator`, `firebase-auth-sdk-integrator`, `supabase-auth-sdk-integrator`, `custom-jwt-auth-implementer`, `frontend-auth-ui-implementer`, `frontend-route-protector`, `backend-api-auth-enforcer`, `auth-session-manager`, and `auth-testing-specialist`.
*   Map out the Squad Workflow and Artifact Flow (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_02_squad_workflow_and_artifact_flow.md]`).
*   Plan Knowledge Acquisition and Research for the squad members (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_03_squad_knowledge_and_research_plan.md]`).
*   Consolidate into a Squad Design Summary & Blueprint (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_04_squad_design_summary_and_blueprint.md]`).
