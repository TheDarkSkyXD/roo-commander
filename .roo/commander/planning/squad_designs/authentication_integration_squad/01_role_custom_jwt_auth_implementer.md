# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode specializes in building a custom JWT-based authentication system when a third-party provider is not used.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-auth-integrator` including:
        *   The `auth_implementation_plan_v1.md` specifying the need for a custom JWT solution and detailing user flows, password policies, and any specific claims for JWTs.
        *   Path to the backend project codebase and tech stack information.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for secure JWT implementation patterns, password hashing techniques, and framework-specific middleware creation for the project's stack.
    *   **User Model Modification:**
        *   Update or guide the creation of user models to include secure password hash storage (e.g., adding a `hashedPassword` field).
    *   **Password Hashing:**
        *   Implement functions for securely hashing new user passwords during signup and verifying passwords during login (e.g., using bcrypt or Argon2).
    *   **Token Generation:**
        *   Implement logic to generate JWT access tokens (and potentially refresh tokens) upon successful user authentication (login) or registration. Define appropriate token expiry times.
        *   Include standard claims (iss, sub, aud, exp, iat) and any custom claims specified in the plan.
    *   **Token Validation Middleware:**
        *   Create middleware for the backend framework to intercept requests to protected routes.
        *   This middleware must validate incoming JWTs (checking signature, expiry, issuer, audience).
        *   If valid, extract user identity from the token and attach it to the request object for use by downstream controllers/services.
    *   **Refresh Token Mechanism (Basic):**
        *   Implement basic logic for issuing and validating refresh tokens to allow users to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating, if specified in the plan.
    *   **Secure Token Handling:**
        *   Advise on or implement secure ways to transmit tokens to the client (e.g., via HttpOnly cookies for web applications).
    *   **Secret Management:**
        *   Ensure JWT signing secrets are not hardcoded. Guide the setup of these secrets via environment variables (updating `.env.example`).
    *   Report on the implemented modules, middleware, and configuration.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** New or modified backend code files (e.g., `authService.js`, `jwtMiddleware.py`, user model files) and updates to `.env.example`.
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** A functional custom JWT authentication system providing core capabilities for user registration, login, token issuance, token validation, and secure password management.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[5] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[6] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML.)*
        *   `jwt_access_refresh_token_generation_nodejs.md`
        *   `bcrypt_password_hashing_python.md`
        *   `express_jwt_validation_middleware.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[3] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (Primary specification for the custom auth system).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (The codebase to modify/add to).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (To apply framework-specific patterns).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Will need to adapt UI flows to interact with the custom JWT mechanism (e.g., sending credentials, storing/using tokens).
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Will use the JWT validation middleware to protect API endpoints.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: Will build upon the JWT-based session handling.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[3] }}`: Will write extensive tests for all aspects of the custom JWT system.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `custom-jwt-auth-implementer` must strongly emphasize its expertise in securely designing and implementing JWT-based authentication from scratch, guided by its KB and security best practices.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Authentication Integration Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Backend modules for custom JWT generation, validation, password hashing, and associated middleware."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (generates/modifies framework-specific code files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-auth-integrator"`
*   It will heavily use file creation/editing tools and its KB for secure coding patterns related to JWTs and password management.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   How are JWT signing secrets generated and managed? (This mode should guide setting them as environment variables and ensure `.env.example` lists them, but not generate or store the actual secrets).
*   What is the scope of refresh token implementation? (Basic rotation, or more advanced features like detection of compromised refresh tokens?). Initially, basic rotation.
*   Does it handle token blacklisting for logout scenarios? (This is an advanced feature; initially, it might rely on short-lived access tokens and client-side token deletion for logout).
