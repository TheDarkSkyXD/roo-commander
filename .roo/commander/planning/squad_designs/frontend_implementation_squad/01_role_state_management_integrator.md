# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode specializes in implementing and integrating shared or global state management solutions within the frontend application.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-frontend-implementer` specifying the need for global/shared state management for certain features or data. Inputs will include:
        *   Relevant sections of `frontend_feature_specification_v1.md` detailing shared data requirements.
        *   The chosen state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Pinia) if specified by `web-app-tech-stack-advisor`, or a recommendation to choose one based on project needs.
        *   Paths to components/pages that need to interact with this state.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for setup procedures, best practices, and patterns for the chosen state management library and frontend framework.
    *   Set up the core state management store/architecture (e.g., creating Redux store, slices, reducers; Zustand store; Pinia store).
    *   Define state structure, actions, mutations, getters/selectors as required by the feature specifications.
    *   Refactor or update specified UI components and page/view components to:
        *   Read data from the global/shared state.
        *   Dispatch actions or call mutations to update the state.
    *   Handle asynchronous logic within the state management solution if it's responsible for fetching initial state or handling side effects (though primary API calls might be by `api-client-integrator`, which then updates state via this mode's setup).
    *   Ensure the state management implementation is clean, maintainable, and follows best practices for the chosen library.
    *   Report the files created/modified and a summary of the state management setup.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** New or modified framework-specific code files (e.g., `store/index.js`, `features/userSlice.js`, updated component files).
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** A functional shared/global state management system integrated into the application, allowing components to access and update shared data consistently.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[5] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML. One per state library/framework.)*
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[3] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (To understand what data needs to be managed globally/shared).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (To know which library to implement, if pre-decided).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (The components that will consume or update the state).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[3] }}`

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Will write client-side logic that dispatches actions to, or selects data from, the stores set up by this mode.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Will often update the state (via actions defined by this mode) after successfully fetching or mutating data on the backend.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: Will write tests for the state management logic (actions, reducers, selectors) and for components connected to the state.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `state-management-integrator` should highlight its expertise in various state libraries (via KB) and its role in structuring shared application data flow.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Frontend Implementation Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Integrated global/shared state management solution with connected components."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (creates/modifies framework-specific code and config files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-frontend-implementer"`
*   It will primarily use file creation and editing tools, with a strong reliance on its KB for library-specific implementations.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   Which state management libraries should be prioritized for its initial KB? (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand for React; Pinia/Vuex for Vue; Svelte Stores).
*   How does it handle initial state hydration, especially if data comes from server-side rendering or an initial API call? (It might set up the structure, and `api-client-integrator` might be responsible for the initial fetch that populates it).
*   What's its role in data persistence for state (e.g., using `redux-persist`)? (Could be an advanced skill in its KB).
