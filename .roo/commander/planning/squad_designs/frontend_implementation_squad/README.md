# README: Planning Documents for Frontend Implementation Squad

## 1. Purpose of this Directory üéØ

This directory, `[.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/frontend_implementation_squad/](.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/frontend_implementation_squad/)`, contains the complete set of planning and design documents that define the **"Frontend Implementation Squad"**. This squad is a specialized "Manager + Squad" unit within the Roo Commander system, orchestrated by the `manager-web-app-frontend-implementer` mode. Its mission is to take a scaffolded web application (or an existing frontend codebase) and implement specific UI features, interactivity, state management, and API integrations based on detailed requirements or designs.

The documents herein are created using the standard "Squad Planning & Design" templates located in `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/)`.

## 2. Overview of Contents / Key Files & Subdirectories üìÇ

This directory will contain the following key planning documents, which should ideally be reviewed in sequence as they are developed:

*   **`[./00_concept_mission_frontend_implementation_squad.md](./00_concept_mission_frontend_implementation_squad.md)`**:
    *   Defines the overall mission, purpose, value proposition, and strategic alignment of the Frontend Implementation Squad.

*   **Role Definitions (`01_role_*.md` files):** These documents will detail the specific responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for each member of the Frontend Implementation Squad.
    *   `[./01_role_feature_requirements_analyzer.md](./01_role_feature_requirements_analyzer.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_ui_component_developer.md](./01_role_ui_component_developer.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_page_view_assembler.md](./01_role_page_view_assembler.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_client_logic_implementer.md](./01_role_client_logic_implementer.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_state_management_integrator.md](./01_role_state_management_integrator.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_api_client_integrator.md](./01_role_api_client_integrator.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_frontend_test_writer.md](./01_role_frontend_test_writer.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_accessibility_checker.md](./01_role_accessibility_checker.md)`
    *   `[./01_role_frontend_documentation_updater.md](./01_role_frontend_documentation_updater.md)`

*   **`[./02_workflow_frontend_implementation_squad.md](./02_workflow_frontend_implementation_squad.md)`**:
    *   Will map out the sequential operational workflow of the squad, detailing how tasks and artifacts flow between members to achieve the unit's overall goal of implementing frontend features.

*   **`[./03_research_plan_frontend_implementation_squad.md](./03_research_plan_frontend_implementation_squad.md)`**:
    *   Will identify key knowledge domains required by the squad and outline plans for acquiring this knowledge, including bootstrapping their KBs, potentially using MCP tools.

*   **`[./04_blueprint_frontend_implementation_squad.md](./04_blueprint_frontend_implementation_squad.md)`**:
    *   Will serve as the consolidated summary and final blueprint for the Frontend Implementation Squad, synthesizing information from all the documents listed above. This document will guide the actual development of the `manager-web-app-frontend-implementer` mode and its squad members.

## 3. Usage Notes / How to Contribute (If Applicable) üìù

*   These documents represent the design phase for the Frontend Implementation Squad.
*   The `04_blueprint_frontend_implementation_squad.md` (once created) will be the primary reference for initiating development of this squad's modes.
*   Any proposed changes to the squad's structure, roles, or workflow should ideally be discussed and reflected in updates to these planning documents first.
