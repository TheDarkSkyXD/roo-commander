# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode is the specialist for enabling communication between the frontend application and backend APIs.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-frontend-implementer` specifying API integration needs for a feature. Inputs will include:
        *   Feature specifications detailing data to be fetched or submitted.
        *   API contracts/documentation for the relevant backend endpoints.
        *   Paths to frontend components/pages that will trigger or display data from these API calls.
        *   Information about the chosen state management solution if API data needs to populate global state.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for best practices on using Fetch API, Axios, or other HTTP clients, and for patterns related to the project's framework and state management.
    *   Create or update API service modules/functions to encapsulate the logic for making specific API calls (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
    *   Implement request payload construction and header configuration (e.g., for `Authorization` tokens, `Content-Type`).
    *   Implement robust handling of API responses, including:
        *   Parsing JSON data.
        *   Mapping API response data to frontend data structures if necessary.
        *   Updating component state or dispatching actions to global state (via `state-management-integrator`'s setup) with the received data.
    *   Implement comprehensive error handling for API calls, including:
        *   Catching network errors and different HTTP error status codes.
        *   Updating UI or state to reflect loading states and error conditions.
    *   Integrate these API service calls into the relevant UI components or page logic, often triggered by user actions (handled by `client-logic-implementer`) or component lifecycle events.
    *   Report the files modified/created and a summary of the API integrations implemented.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** New or modified JavaScript/TypeScript files (e.g., `services/api.js`, `hooks/useUserData.js`, updated component files).
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** Frontend application that can successfully communicate with specified backend APIs, fetch and display data, submit data, and handle API-related loading and error states gracefully.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[5] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[6] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML.)*
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[3] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (What data is needed where in the UI).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (Crucial for knowing how to call the backend).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (The UI elements that will trigger calls or display data).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[3] }}` (If API data updates global state).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[4] }}`

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: The logic implemented by `client-logic-implementer` will often be what calls the API services created by this mode, or consumes the data it makes available in components/state.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Will write tests that mock these API calls to verify frontend behavior in isolation and integration tests that hit actual (or test-doubled) endpoints.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `api-client-integrator` should emphasize its expertise in client-server communication, handling asynchronous data, and integrating with various API styles (REST, GraphQL if added to KB).
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Frontend Implementation Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Integrated API communication logic, including service modules and updated components/state."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (creates/modifies framework-specific code files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-frontend-implementer"`
*   It will heavily use file reading, code modification tools, and its KB for patterns like using Axios, Fetch, and integrating with state management for API data.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   Which HTTP client libraries should it primarily support via its KB (e.g., Fetch API, Axios)? (Fetch is built-in, Axios is popular; supporting both via KB is good).
*   How does it handle authentication tokens for API calls? (It should expect to retrieve tokens from an auth state/service, possibly set up by `state-management-integrator` or an auth specialist, and include them in headers as per API contract).
*   What level of data transformation or mapping is it responsible for? (Basic mapping to fit frontend models; complex transformations might be a separate concern or a more advanced skill).
