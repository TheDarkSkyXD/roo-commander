# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode brings life to the static UI by implementing client-side interactivity and logic.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-frontend-implementer` specifying client-side logic to be implemented for certain components or pages. Inputs will include:
        *   Relevant sections of `frontend_feature_specification_v1.md` detailing user interactions, event responses, and conditional behaviors.
        *   Paths to the target component/page files created by `ui-component-developer` and `page-view-assembler`.
        *   The chosen frontend framework.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for framework-specific event handling, state management (local component state), and DOM interaction patterns.
    *   Write JavaScript/TypeScript code within the specified components/pages to:
        *   Handle user events (e.g., button clicks, form submissions, input changes, mouse movements).
        *   Implement conditional rendering of UI elements based on state or props.
        *   Perform client-side data validation for forms.
        *   Manage local component state required for UI logic (if not handled by a global state manager for that specific piece of logic).
        *   Implement simple client-side data transformations, sorting, or filtering if specified.
    *   Ensure the implemented logic is efficient and does not introduce performance bottlenecks.
    *   Report the files modified and a summary of the logic implemented.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Modifications to existing framework-specific code files (e.g., `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`).
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** Components and pages that are interactive and respond to user actions as per the feature specifications. The UI becomes dynamic based on this mode's work.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[5] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML. One per framework for common logic patterns.)*
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[3] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (Specifies the logic and interactions to implement).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (The actual UI code to be modified).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (To use correct framework conventions).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[3] }}`

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: If the implemented logic has implications for global app state, this mode will integrate it.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: If user interactions implemented by this mode need to trigger API calls (e.g., submitting a form after validation).
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: Will write tests to verify the correctness of the implemented client-side logic and user interactions.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `client-logic-implementer` should emphasize its expertise in JavaScript/TypeScript and framework-specific event handling and local state, guided by its KB.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Frontend Implementation Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Modified component/page files with implemented client-side interactivity and logic."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (modifies framework-specific code files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-frontend-implementer"`
*   It will heavily use file reading and precise code modification tools.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   What is the boundary between "local component state" handled by this mode and global state handled by `state-management-integrator`? (This mode handles UI-specific state; `state-management-integrator` handles shared application state).
*   How complex should the data manipulations it performs be? (Simple formatting, sorting, filtering. Complex business logic should ideally be on the backend or in a dedicated state layer).
*   Does it handle optimistic updates or loading states for UI interactions? (Could be a basic implementation, with more advanced handling by `api-client-integrator` or `state-management-integrator`).
