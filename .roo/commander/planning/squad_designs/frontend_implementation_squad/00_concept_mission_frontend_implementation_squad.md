# Squad Concept & Mission: {{ squad_unit_name }}

## 1. Overview & Purpose üéØ

*   **Squad Unit Name:** `{{ squad_unit_name }}`
*   **Proposed Managing Mode:** `{{ proposed_managing_mode_name }}` (`{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}`)
*   **Primary Domain Focus:** `{{ primary_domain_focus }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the foundational concept, mission, strategic alignment, and value proposition for the proposed `{{ squad_unit_name }}`. This unit specializes in the detailed implementation of frontend web application features.

## 2. Mission Statement üöÄ

The mission of the `{{ squad_unit_name }}`, orchestrated by the `{{ proposed_managing_mode_name }}`, is to provide an AI-assisted service for implementing robust, interactive, and well-structured frontend features and components for web applications, leveraging specified frameworks and adhering to design requirements and best practices.

## 3. Problem/Opportunity Addressed ü§î

*   **User/System Problem Solved:** `{{ solves_specific_user_problem }}`
*   **Opportunity:** To empower developers to build out the frontend of their applications more rapidly by delegating common feature implementation tasks (e.g., building forms, displaying data, handling user interactions, integrating APIs) to specialized AI modes. This allows for a focus on more complex or unique aspects of the application.

## 4. Core Capabilities of the Unit ‚ú®

The `{{ squad_unit_name }}` will, through its specialist members, be capable of:
*   Understanding detailed feature requirements, UI designs/mockups, and API specifications.
*   Implementing UI components using specified frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js) and UI libraries (e.g., MUI, Shadcn/ui, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS).
*   Writing client-side logic for user interactions, event handling, and data manipulation.
*   Integrating with frontend state management solutions (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Pinia, Vuex, Svelte Stores).
*   Connecting frontend components to backend APIs for data fetching and submission.
*   Implementing form handling and validation.
*   Ensuring basic responsiveness and accessibility in implemented components.
*   Writing unit and integration tests for frontend components and logic.
*   Updating relevant documentation for the implemented features.

## 5. Target Users / Beneficiaries üë•

*   `{{ key_stakeholders_or_beneficiaries | join: "; " }}`.
*   Developers working on either new (scaffolded) projects or existing web applications who need to add or modify frontend features.

## 6. Strategic Alignment üîó

*   `{{ aligns_with_overall_system_goal }}`
*   This squad directly complements the "Web App Scaffolding Squad" by taking the generated scaffold and building upon it. It also serves as a standalone capability for enhancing existing projects.

## 7. Value Proposition & Key Outputs üåü

*   **Primary Value Proposition:** `{{ primary_value_proposition }}`
*   **Target Primary Output of the Unit:** `{{ target_primary_output_of_unit }}`
    *   This typically involves modifications to an existing codebase (adding new files, updating existing ones) rather than generating an entirely new project from scratch (unless the "existing project" is just the output of the scaffolding squad).

## 8. High-Level Success Metrics for the Unit üìà

*   *(Corresponds to `key_success_metrics_for_unit` in TOML)*
    *   Accuracy and completeness of implemented frontend features against requirements.
    *   Quality of the generated frontend code (readability, maintainability, adherence to framework conventions).
    *   Efficiency of the feature implementation process (time/effort reduction).
    *   Successful integration with specified backend APIs and state management solutions.
    *   User/developer satisfaction with the implemented frontend features.

## 9. Initial Assumptions & Dependencies (Conceptual) üìù

*   **Key Assumptions:**
    *   AI modes can be specialized to implement features within specific frontend frameworks, guided by rich KBs.
    *   Users can provide clear, detailed requirements for frontend features (e.g., user stories, UI mockups, API endpoint details).
    *   A scaffolded project or an existing, understandable codebase is available as a starting point.
*   **Potential Dependencies:**
    *   Output from the "Web App Scaffolding Squad" (if starting a new project).
    *   Clear API contracts from a backend team/squad (if integrating with existing or concurrently developed APIs).
    *   Design specifications or mockups (potentially from a future "UI/UX Design Squad" or user-provided).
    *   Relies on well-maintained KBs for the specialist implementer modes, to be populated by `meta-kb-editor`.

## 10. Next Steps in Squad Design ‚û°Ô∏è

*   Define individual Squad Member Roles for the `{{ squad_unit_name }}` (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md]`). This will involve identifying roles like `frontend-ui-builder`, `frontend-state-logic-integrator`, `frontend-api-client-integrator`, `frontend-test-writer`, etc.
*   Map out the Squad Workflow and Artifact Flow (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_02_squad_workflow_and_artifact_flow.md]`).
*   Plan Knowledge Acquisition and Research for the squad members (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_03_squad_knowledge_and_research_plan.md]`).
*   Consolidate into a Squad Design Summary & Blueprint (using `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_04_squad_design_summary_and_blueprint.md]`).
