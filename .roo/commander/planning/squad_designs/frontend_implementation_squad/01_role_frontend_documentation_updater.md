# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode ensures that frontend features and components are adequately documented as they are developed.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-frontend-implementer` specifying frontend code that requires documentation. Inputs will include:
        *   Paths to the relevant component/page/logic files.
        *   Feature specifications or component design documents to understand context and purpose.
        *   Information about the project's documentation tools and standards (e.g., JSDoc, TSDoc, Storybook).
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for best practices in technical writing, JSDoc/TSDoc conventions, and Storybook story creation for the project's framework.
    *   **Inline Code Documentation:**
        *   Add or update JSDoc/TSDoc blocks for functions, classes, components, props, methods, and return values in the provided code files.
        *   Ensure comments are clear, accurate, and explain the purpose, parameters, and usage.
    *   **Component Showcase/Examples (e.g., Storybook):**
        *   If Storybook (or a similar tool) is used in the project, create or update story files (`*.stories.js/jsx/ts/tsx`) for new or modified UI components.
        *   Define appropriate args, controls, and actions to showcase component variations and interactivity.
    *   **Separate Markdown Documentation (If applicable):**
        *   If the project maintains a separate component library guide or feature documentation in Markdown, update relevant sections or create new pages for the implemented features/components.
    *   Ensure all documentation adheres to the project's style and formatting guidelines.
    *   Report the files modified/created and a summary of the documentation updates.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Modifications to existing code files (adding JSDoc/TSDoc), new Storybook story files (e.g., `.stories.tsx`), or new/updated `.md` documentation files.
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** Clear, accurate, and developer-friendly documentation that improves the understandability and maintainability of the frontend codebase.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[5] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML.)*
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[3] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (The code that needs documenting).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (To understand what the code does and its purpose).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (To know which documentation tools/formats to use).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Will use this documentation to understand how to use components, integrate features, and maintain the codebase.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: May refer to component prop/event documentation when writing tests.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: Uses the report to confirm documentation tasks are complete.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `frontend-documentation-updater` should emphasize its technical writing skills and its ability to generate various forms of frontend documentation (inline, Storybook, Markdown), guided by its KB.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Frontend Implementation Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Updated code with inline documentation, new/updated Storybook stories, or Markdown documentation files."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (modifies code or creates specific documentation files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-frontend-implementer"`
*   It will primarily use file reading and precise code/text modification tools.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   What specific documentation tools (e.g., Storybook, Docusaurus, TypeDoc) should its initial KB prioritize for generating skills/procedures?
*   How does it handle documenting complex state interactions or API integrations? (It should focus on documenting the component's public interface and props/events related to these, rather than the internal implementation details of the state/API services themselves, which would be documented by their respective specialists).
*   What's the trigger for this mode? After every component is built, or as a batch job for a completed feature? (Likely tasked by the Manager after a feature's core components and logic are implemented).
