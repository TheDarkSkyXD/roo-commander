# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode is responsible for taking individual UI components and arranging them into complete, structured pages or views within the application.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-frontend-implementer` specifying a page or view to be assembled. Inputs will include:
        *   Feature specifications detailing the components needed for the page and their general arrangement (from `frontend_feature_specification_v1.md`).
        *   UI mockups or layout designs for the page.
        *   Paths to the already developed UI components (from `ui-component-developer`).
        *   The target frontend framework.
    *   Consult its Knowledge Base for framework-specific conventions on page/view structure, component importation, and layout composition.
    *   Create or modify the main file for the page/view (e.g., `UserProfilePage.jsx`, `views/ProductDetail.vue`).
    *   Import the required individual UI components into this page/view file.
    *   Arrange and nest these components according to the design specifications, using appropriate HTML structuring elements (divs, sections, articles, etc.) and layout CSS (e.g., Tailwind classes if used by the project, or framework-specific layout components).
    *   Pass down necessary (placeholder or basic) props to child components as indicated by the feature specification.
    *   Ensure the assembled page/view adheres to any root layout components (e.g., main app shell with header/footer) if they exist.
    *   Report the path to the created/modified page/view file.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** Framework-specific code files (e.g., `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.svelte`).
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** Well-structured page/view files that correctly import and compose individual UI components to match the intended design layout. These pages should be ready for routing and for more complex client-side logic or state management to be added.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML. One per supported framework.)*
        *   `composing_pages_in_nextjs_with_app_router.md`
        *   `building_views_in_vue_using_sfc_imports.md`
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}` (Defines what components go on the page and their general layout).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}` (Visual guide for assembly).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}` (The actual building blocks).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[3] }}` (To use correct framework conventions).
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[4] }}` (Where to create/modify the page file).

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Will add specific business logic, complex event handling, or orchestrate state across the components within these assembled pages.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Will connect these assembled pages/views to global application state.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: Will wire up data fetching calls at the page/view level or within components on these pages.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[3] }}`: Will write tests for these complete pages/views.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `page-view-assembler` should emphasize its role in composing larger UI structures from smaller, pre-built components, adhering to framework conventions for page creation.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Frontend Implementation Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "Page-level component files or view templates that arrange UI components into complete user interfaces."`
    *   `primary_output_template = "N/A (creates/modifies framework-specific page/view files)"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-frontend-implementer"`
*   It will primarily use file creation and editing tools, with a strong reliance on its KB for framework-specific page construction patterns.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   How does it handle shared layouts (e.g., app shells with headers, footers, sidebars)? (It should assume these are either pre-existing from scaffolding or that it might be tasked to create/use a basic page layout component).
*   What is the expected level of detail for "placeholder props" it passes to child components? (Initially, minimal, just enough for structural assembly; actual data flow logic comes later).
