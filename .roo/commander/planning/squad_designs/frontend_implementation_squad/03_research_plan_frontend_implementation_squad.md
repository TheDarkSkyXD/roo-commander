# Squad Knowledge & Research Plan: {{ squad_unit_name_ref }}

## 1. Overview & Purpose üéØ

*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To identify the key knowledge domains and specific information required for the `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}` to operate effectively.

## 3. Information Gathering & Research Strategy üîç

### 3.1. General Approach for Framework/Library/Tool Specifics (Domains 2-9)
*   **Targeted For:** KBs of all specialist implementer, tester, and documenter modes.
*   **Internal Sources Review:**
    *   Any existing KBs from the "Web App Scaffolding Squad" (e.g., `generic-project-scaffolder` KB might have info on basic framework setup that can be expanded).
    *   `[.roo/commander/docs/standards/]` for general coding and documentation styles.
*   **External Research Plan (MCP & Manual):**
    *   **Key Questions for Research (Iterate per framework/library/tool, e.g., for React & Redux):**
        *   "Official documentation for React functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)."
        *   "Best practices for structuring React components and managing props."
        *   "Official documentation for Redux Toolkit: store setup, createSlice, createAsyncThunk."
        *   "Patterns for connecting React components to Redux store."
        *   "Common testing patterns for React components using Jest and React Testing Library."
        *   "Storybook for React: CSF format, args, controls, actions."
        *   "WCAG guidelines for common web components like forms, modals, navigation."
    *   **Suggested MCP Tools & Queries:**
        *   `[Tool: vertex-ai-mcp-server/answer_query_websearch]` - Queries like: "react functional components tutorial", "redux toolkit official docs", "jest react testing library tutorial", "storybook react csf".
        *   `[Tool: fetch-mcp/get_url_content]` - URLs: Official documentation for React, Redux, Jest, RTL, Storybook, Vue, Pinia, Svelte, Vitest, Playwright, WCAG, etc.
        *   `[Tool: crawl4ai-mcp/crawl_website]` - Target: Official docs sites for comprehensive information.
    *   **Repomix Consideration:** Analyze high-quality open-source projects using these stacks to extract common patterns, best practices, and example implementations for KBs.
*   **Expected Output of this Research:**
    *   A comprehensive set of `skill` articles for each relevant mode's KB, detailing framework/library-specific implementation techniques.
    *   `reference` articles summarizing key APIs, commands, or configurations.
    *   `example` articles showcasing code snippets or small project structures.

### 3.2. Information/Skill: Feature Specification Analysis (Domain 1)
*   **Targeted For:** KB of `feature-requirements-analyzer`.
*   **External Research Plan:**
    *   **Key Questions:** "Techniques for decomposing UI/UX designs into components," "Best practices for writing frontend technical specifications," "How to map user stories to frontend tasks."
    *   **Suggested MCP Tools:** Web search for articles on requirements analysis, agile user story mapping, UI decomposition.
*   **Expected Output:** `skill` and `wisdom` articles for `feature-requirements-analyzer`.

## 4. Proposed Knowledge Base (KB) Structure for the Squad üèóÔ∏è

*   Each of the 9 squad members will have its own KB.
*   **Generic Implementers (`ui-component-developer`, `client-logic-implementer`, `state-management-integrator`, `api-client-integrator`, `frontend-test-writer`):** Their KBs will be heavily populated with framework/library-specific `skill` articles, organized by technology (e.g., `kb/skills/react/`, `kb/skills/vue/`, `kb/skills/redux/`).
*   **`feature-requirements-analyzer`:** KB will focus on `skills` for analysis and `templates` (for its output `frontend_feature_specification.md`).
*   **`page-view-assembler`:** KB will have `skills` for page composition in different frameworks.
*   **`accessibility-checker`:** KB will have `skills` for specific checks and `reference` to WCAG guidelines.
*   **`frontend-documentation-updater`:** KB will have `skills` for JSDoc/TSDoc, Storybook, and `reference` to documentation style guides.

## 5. Research Execution & Coordination üöÄ

*   **Responsibility:** `{{ research_coordinator_proposed }}` will assign MDTM tasks to `meta-kb-editor` (or `agent-research`) to perform targeted research for each domain and draft initial KB articles for each squad member.
*   **Timeline (Conceptual):** Foundational KB articles for 1-2 core frontend stacks (e.g., React/Next.js with Redux/Zustand and Jest/RTL) should be prioritized to make the squad minimally viable. Support for other stacks can be added iteratively.
*   **Deliverables:** A set of initial KB articles (primarily `skills` and `reference` documents) for each of the 9 squad members, focusing on their core responsibilities for the chosen initial frameworks/tools.

This plan will guide the foundational knowledge acquisition for the `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`, enabling its members to effectively implement a wide range of frontend features.
