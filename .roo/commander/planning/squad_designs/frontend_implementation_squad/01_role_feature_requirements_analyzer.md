# Squad Member Role Definition: {{ proposed_mode_name }}

## 1. Overview üìù

*   **Proposed Mode Name:** `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`
*   **Proposed Mode Slug:** `{{ proposed_mode_slug }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `{{ proposed_classification }}`
*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name_ref }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the role, responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs for the `{{ proposed_mode_name }}`. This mode acts as the initial analytical step within the Frontend Implementation Squad, ensuring feature requests are well-understood and broken down for effective frontend development.

## 2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus üéØ

*   **Summary:** `{{ core_responsibility_summary }}`
*   **Detailed Responsibilities:**
    *   Receive an MDTM task from `manager-web-app-frontend-implementer` containing high-level feature requirements, user stories, UI designs (e.g., mockups, wireframes), and relevant API contract information.
    *   Thoroughly analyze all provided input materials.
    *   Identify and list all new or modified frontend UI components required to implement the feature. For each component, specify its purpose and key interactive elements if discernible from designs.
    *   Outline the necessary client-side logic and user interactions associated with the feature (e.g., "on button click, validate form and call API X").
    *   Specify the data requirements for each component/view, including what data needs to be fetched from APIs and what data needs to be managed in client-side state.
    *   Identify any dependencies on other features or backend services.
    *   Formulate clarifying questions for the Manager if requirements or designs are ambiguous or incomplete.
    *   Compile all this analysis into a structured `frontend_feature_specification_v1.md` document.

## 3. Primary Output Artifact(s) üìÑ‚û°Ô∏è

*   **Description:** `{{ primary_output_artifact_description }}`
*   **Format/Template:** TOML+Markdown, using a new template: `{{ primary_output_artifact_template_ref }}`.
    *   *(We will need to define `template_frontend_feature_specification.md`. It would likely include sections for: Feature Overview, Target User Stories, UI Component Breakdown (name, purpose, key elements), Client-Side Logic/Interactions, Data Requirements (API endpoints, state needs), Dependencies, Open Questions.)*
*   **Key Characteristics of Output:** The specification must be detailed and clear enough for other frontend squad members (`ui-component-developer`, `client-logic-implementer`, etc.) to begin their implementation tasks.

## 4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required üß†

*   **Essential Skills/Technologies:**
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[0] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[1] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[2] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[3] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[4] }}`
    *   `{{ key_skills_required[5] }}`
*   **Potential KB Topics (to bootstrap its expertise):**
    *   **Skills (`kb/skills/`):**
        *   *(Corresponds to `potential_kb_skill_topics` in TOML.)*
    *   **Wisdom (`kb/wisdom/`):**
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[0] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[1] }}`
        *   `{{ potential_kb_wisdom_topics[2] }}`

## 5. Interactions & Dependencies within the Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 5.1. Typical Input Artifacts Expected
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[0] }}`
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[1] }}`
*   `{{ typical_input_artifacts_expected[2] }}`
*   (Potentially) Access to the existing codebase if modifying a feature.

### 5.2. Downstream Dependencies (Who uses its output?)
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[0] }}`: Uses the component specifications to build individual UI components.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[1] }}`: Uses the overall feature breakdown and component list to assemble pages/views.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[2] }}`: Uses the specified client-side logic requirements to implement interactivity.
*   `{{ downstream_squad_members_dependent_on_output[3] }}`: Uses this detailed specification to create and assign more granular sub-tasks to the other implementer modes in the squad.

## 6. Considerations for `.mode.md` & System Prompt üí°

*   The `roleDefinition` for `feature-requirements-analyzer` should emphasize its analytical skills in breaking down feature requests into concrete frontend tasks and specifications.
*   Its `[metadata]` should include:
    *   `squad_name = "Frontend Implementation Squad"`
    *   `primary_output_description = "A frontend_feature_specification_v1.md detailing components, interactions, and data needs for a feature."`
    *   `primary_output_template = ".roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/web_app_dev/template_frontend_feature_specification.md"`
    *   `reports_to = "manager-web-app-frontend-implementer"`
*   It will primarily use reading and analytical capabilities, and then document generation tools/skills.

## 7. Open Questions / Further Definition Needed ‚ùì

*   The exact structure of `template_frontend_feature_specification.md` needs to be defined.
*   How does it handle very large features? Does it break them into multiple specification documents, or one large one? (One per manageable feature/epic seems appropriate).
*   What's the process if API contracts are missing or incomplete? (It should flag this as a major blocker/dependency).
