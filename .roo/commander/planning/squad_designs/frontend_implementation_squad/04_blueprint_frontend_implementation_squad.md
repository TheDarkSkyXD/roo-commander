*   **Total Squad Members Proposed:** `{{ number_of_squad_members }}`

## 5. Workflow & Artifact Flow Overview üîÑ

The squad typically operates by first analyzing detailed feature requirements, then iteratively developing components, assembling them into pages, implementing client-side logic, integrating state and API calls, and finally testing, checking accessibility, and documenting the implemented features. The `{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}` orchestrates this flow, managing dependencies and artifact handoffs between specialists. The detailed flow is documented in `{{ linked_workflow_doc }}`.

**Visual Flow (High-Level - Refer to detailed diagram in `{{ linked_workflow_doc }}`):**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Start: Mgr Task (Feature Spec, UI Design, API Contract)"] --> B("`feature-requirements-analyzer`");
    B -- Frontend Feature Spec --> C("`ui-component-developer`");
    C -- Components --> D("`page-view-assembler`");
    D -- Assembled Pages --> E("`client-logic-implementer`");

    I -- Tests --> L["End: Implemented, Tested, Documented Feature"];
    J -- A11y Notes --> L;
    K -- Docs --> L;
```

## 6. Key Knowledge & Research Requirements Summary üìö

The effectiveness of this squad relies on its members having deep, framework-specific knowledge, primarily stored and accessed via their KBs. Key research areas (detailed in `{{ linked_research_plan_doc }}`) include:
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[0] }}`
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[1] }}`
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[2] }}`
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[3] }}`
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[4] }}`
*   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[5] }}`
*   Initial KBs will need to be populated for common frontend stacks (e.g., React/Next.js with Redux/Zustand, Vue with Pinia, Svelte with Svelte Stores) and associated tooling (Jest/Vitest, RTL, Storybook, WCAG).

## 7. Proposed Next Steps for Development üõ†Ô∏è

1.  **Architectural Review and Approval:** Finalize and approve this Squad Design Blueprint.
2.  **Manager Mode Definition:** Create the `.mode.md`, rules, and initial KB (README, main orchestration procedure, squad composition reference) for `{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}`.
3.  **Squad Member Mode Definitions:** For each of the 9 squad members listed:
    *   Create their `.mode.md` file using `[.roo/commander/templates/modes/squad/template_00_squad.mode.md]`, populating from their respective Role Definition documents.
    *   Create their `[.roo/rules-[slug]/00-[slug]-core-principles.md]` file.
4.  **KB Bootstrapping:** Begin populating the KBs for the squad members with procedures and reference material for 1-2 initial target frameworks/tools, based on the Research Plan. This will be an ongoing task for `meta-kb-editor`.
5.  **Template Creation:** Design and create the new templates identified:
    *   `[.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/web_app_dev/template_frontend_feature_specification.md]`
    *   `[.roo/commander/templates/audits/template_01_accessibility_review_notes.md]`
6.  **Integration:** Update `üëë Roo Commander`'s KB to make `{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}` available (if it's to be directly callable by `üëë Roo Commander` for feature implementation on existing projects).
7.  **Iterative Testing:** Conduct end-to-end testing of the feature implementation workflow for an initial target stack and simple feature.

This blueprint provides a comprehensive plan for developing the `{{ squad_unit_name }}`.
