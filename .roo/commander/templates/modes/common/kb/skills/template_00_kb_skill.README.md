# Documentation: Template `template_00_kb_skill.md`

## 1. Purpose

This template defines the standard structure for creating **Knowledge Base (KB) Skill documents**. These documents are stored within a mode's `kb/skills/` directory and are designed to codify specific, actionable techniques, "how-to" guides for particular domain-specific methods, or detailed usage instructions for abstract concepts or tools relevant to a mode's specialist function.

KB Skill documents represent the practical, applied knowledge of a mode â€“ its library of learned abilities. They focus on *how to do* specific expert tasks within its domain.

## 2. Usage

1.  **Copy Template:** When documenting a new skill for a mode's KB:
    *   Copy `.roo/commander/templates/modes/common/kb/skills/template_00_kb_skill.md` to the relevant mode's `kb/skills/` directory (or a relevant subdirectory within `skills/`).
2.  **Rename File:** Rename the copied file descriptively, indicating the skill (e.g., `01-conducting-swot-analysis.md`, `how-to-write-effective-user-stories.md`).
3.  **Populate TOML Frontmatter:**
    *   Fill in all placeholders in the TOML block of the new skill file.
    *   `id`: Unique ID for this KB skill, including mode slug and version (e.g., `KB-SKILL-DPS-SWOT-V1`).
    *   `title`: `"[Mode Name]: Skill - [Descriptive Title of the Skill]"`.
    *   `scope`: Describe the skill and its relevance to the specific mode.
    *   `target_audience`: **MUST** be the slug of the mode this skill is for.
    *   `tags`: Include `"kb"`, `"skill"`, `"how-to"`, `"[mode_slug_tag]"`, and keywords for the skill's content.
    *   `related_context`: Link to the mode's `.mode.md`, its KB `README.md`, and any KB procedures that might invoke this skill or wisdom articles that provide principles for it.
    *   (Optional) `skill_category`, `tools_or_concepts_involved`, `proficiency_level_assumed`, `common_pitfalls_to_avoid`.
4.  **Define Skill Content in Markdown:**
    *   Replace all bracketed placeholders like `[Mode Name]` and `[mode_slug]` with actual values.
    *   **Crucially, customize Section 4 ("Step-by-Step 'How-To' / Methodology")** with the detailed, actionable steps for performing the skill.
    *   Fill in other sections (Objective, When to Apply, Prerequisites, Best Practices, Expected Outcome, Pitfalls) with information relevant to this specific skill.
