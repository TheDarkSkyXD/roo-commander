# Squad Concept & Mission: {{ squad_unit_name | default: "[Specify Squad Unit Name]" }}

## 1. Overview & Purpose üéØ

*   **Squad Unit Name:** `{{ squad_unit_name | default: "[Specify Squad Unit Name]" }}`
*   **Proposed Managing Mode:** `{{ proposed_managing_mode_name | default: "[Proposed Manager Name]" }}` (`{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug | default: "[manager-slug]" }}`)
*   **Primary Domain Focus:** `{{ primary_domain_focus | default: "[Describe core domain]" }}`
*   **Purpose of this Document:** To define the foundational concept, mission, strategic alignment, and value proposition for the proposed `[Squad Unit Name]`. This document serves as the starting point for designing this new capability within the Roo Commander V8 ecosystem.

## 2. Mission Statement üöÄ

[Provide a clear and concise mission statement for this Manager + Squad unit. What is its overarching goal and reason for existence within the system?]

## 3. Problem/Opportunity Addressed ü§î

*   **User/System Problem Solved:** `{{ solves_specific_user_problem | default: "[Detail the specific problem or unmet need this unit will address.]" }}`
*   **Opportunity:** [What new opportunities does this unit enable? What capabilities will it unlock?]

## 4. Core Capabilities of the Unit ‚ú®

[List the primary capabilities or services this Manager + Squad unit will provide. What complex tasks will it be able to accomplish through the coordinated efforts of its Manager and Squad members?]
*   Capability 1:
*   Capability 2:
*   ...

## 5. Target Users / Beneficiaries üë•

*   Who are the primary users or beneficiaries of the outputs produced by this squad unit?
*   `{{ key_stakeholders_or_beneficiaries | default: "[List key stakeholders or user groups]" }}`

## 6. Strategic Alignment üîó

*   How does the mission and capabilities of this proposed squad unit align with the broader goals of Roo Commander V8 or the projects it supports?
*   `{{ aligns_with_overall_system_goal | default: "[Explain alignment]" }}`

## 7. Value Proposition & Key Outputs üåü

*   **Primary Value Proposition:** `{{ primary_value_proposition | default: "[What is the unique value delivered by this unit? Why is it important?]" }}`
*   **Target Primary Output of the Unit:** `{{ target_primary_output_of_unit | default: "[Describe the main tangible deliverable]" }}`
    *   [Add more detail about the characteristics or quality expected of this primary output.]

## 8. High-Level Success Metrics for the Unit üìà

[How will the overall success and effectiveness of this Manager + Squad unit be measured once it's operational? These are not for a single PoC, but for the unit's ongoing contribution.]
*   *(Corresponds to `key_success_metrics_for_unit` in TOML)*
    *   Metric 1:
    *   Metric 2:
    *   ...

## 9. Initial Assumptions & Dependencies (Conceptual) üìù

*   **Key Assumptions:** [List any high-level assumptions being made in proposing this squad unit (e.g., availability of certain core Roo Code features, feasibility of AI specialization for the roles).]
*   **Potential Dependencies:** [Are there other existing modes, workspace standards, or external tools this unit might depend on conceptually?]

## 10. Next Steps in Squad Design ‚û°Ô∏è

*   Define individual Squad Member Roles (using `template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md`).
*   Map out the Squad Workflow and Artifact Flow (using `template_02_squad_workflow_and_artifact_flow.md`).
*   Plan Knowledge Acquisition and Research (using `template_03_squad_knowledge_and_research_plan.md`).
*   Consolidate into a Squad Design Summary & Blueprint (using `template_04_squad_design_summary_and_blueprint.md`).
