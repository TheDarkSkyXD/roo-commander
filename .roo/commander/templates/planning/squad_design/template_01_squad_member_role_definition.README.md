# Documentation: Template `template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md`

## 1. Purpose

This template is used during the **Squad Planning & Design phase** to define the specific role, responsibilities, core skills, primary inputs, and key outputs for **each individual Squad Member mode** that will form part of a new "Manager + Squad" unit.

Multiple instances of this document will be created ‚Äì one for every proposed specialist worker in the new squad. The information captured here serves as a detailed specification that directly informs the creation of the squad member's actual `.mode.md` definition file (including its `roleDefinition` and `metadata`) and the initial structure and content ideas for its Knowledge Base (KB).

## 2. Usage

1.  **Context:** This template is typically used after the `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_00_squad_concept_and_mission.md]` has been filled out, defining the overall purpose of the new squad unit.
2.  **Create One Per Squad Member:**
    *   For each distinct role identified for the new squad, an agent (like `architect-squad-designer`) or a human developer will copy `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md)` into the squad's planning directory (e.g., `[.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/new_squad_name/]`).
3.  **Rename File:** Rename the copied file to clearly identify the specific squad member role it defines (e.g., `01_role_frontend_builder.md`, `01_role_data_product_strategist.md`).
4.  **Populate TOML Frontmatter (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all placeholders (e.g., `[SquadUnitNameShort]`, `[ProposedModeSlugShort]`, `[Proposed Mode Name]`, `[Squad Unit Name]`, `[squad_name_tag]`, `[specialization_tag]`) with actual values.
    *   `squad_unit_name_ref` **MUST** match the `squad_unit_name` from the corresponding `00_squad_concept_and_mission.md`.
    *   `proposed_mode_slug` and `proposed_mode_name` are **REQUIRED**.
    *   `proposed_classification` **MUST be `"squad"`**.
    *   `created_date` and `last_updated` should be set to the current date/timestamp by the creating agent.
    *   Fill in "Core Function & Deliverables," "Skills & Knowledge," and "Interactions & Dependencies" sections in the TOML with summary information, or remove fields if not applicable (as per placeholder guidance).
5.  **Define Role in Markdown Body (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all `{{ ... }}` and `[ ... ]` placeholders with specific information for this role.
    *   Elaborate on the TOML fields, providing detailed descriptions for responsibilities, outputs, skills, KB topics, and workflow interactions. Ensure all paths use the `.roo/` anchor.
