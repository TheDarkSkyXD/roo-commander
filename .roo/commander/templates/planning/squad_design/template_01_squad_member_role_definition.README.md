# Documentation: Template `template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md`

## 1. Purpose

This template is used during the **Squad Planning & Design phase** to define the specific role, responsibilities, core skills, primary inputs, and key outputs for **each individual Squad Member mode** that will form part of a new "Manager + Squad" unit.

Multiple instances of this document will be created â€“ one for every proposed specialist worker in the new squad. The information captured here serves as a detailed specification that directly informs the creation of the squad member's actual `.mode.md` definition file and the initial structure of its Knowledge Base (KB).

## 2. Usage

1.  **Context:** This template is typically used after the `template_00_squad_concept_and_mission.md` has been filled out, defining the overall purpose of the new squad unit.
2.  **Create One Per Squad Member:**
    *   For each distinct role identified for the new squad, copy `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md)` into the squad's planning directory (e.g., `[.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/new_squad_name/](.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/new_squad_name/)`).
3.  **Rename File:** Rename the copied file to clearly identify the specific squad member role it defines (e.g., `01_role_frontend_builder.md`, `01_role_strategist.md`).
4.  **Populate TOML Frontmatter:**
    *   Fill in all placeholders.
    *   `id`: Unique ID for this role definition document.
    *   `title`: `Squad Member Role Definition: [Proposed Mode Name] for [Squad Unit Name]`.
    *   `squad_unit_name_ref`: Must match the `squad_unit_name` from the corresponding `00_squad_concept_and_mission.md`.
    *   Define `proposed_mode_slug` and `proposed_mode_name`.
    *   Detail `core_responsibility_summary`, `primary_output_artifact_description`, `key_skills_required`, etc.
    *   Add relevant `tags`.
5.  **Define Role in Markdown Body:**
    *   Fill in all sections of the Markdown body, elaborating on the TOML fields and providing a clear, detailed specification for this squad member's function.
