# Documentation: Template `template_03_squad_knowledge_and_research_plan.md`

## 1. Purpose

This template is used during the **Squad Planning & Design phase** to create a **Squad Knowledge & Research Plan**. Its purpose is to systematically identify:
*   The key knowledge domains and specific information/skills required for a new "Manager + Squad" unit to operate effectively.
*   Existing internal workspace resources (standards, other KBs) or user-provided information that can furnish this knowledge.
*   Gaps where external research is needed to acquire knowledge.
*   A plan for conducting this research, including the potential use of Mode Control Protocol (MCP) tools (e.g., web search, content fetching, code analysis via Repomix).
*   An initial proposal for structuring the Knowledge Bases (KBs) of the new Manager and its Squad members based on the research findings.

This document helps ensure that new squads are "bootstrapped" with the necessary foundational knowledge to perform their roles from the outset.

## 2. Usage

1.  **Context:** This template is typically used after `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_00_squad_concept_and_mission.md]` and multiple instances of `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md]` have identified the squad's purpose and the roles/skills of its members.
2.  **Copy Template:**
    *   An agent (like `architect-squad-designer`) or a human developer will copy `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_03_squad_knowledge_and_research_plan.md](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_03_squad_knowledge_and_research_plan.md)` into the new squad's planning directory.
3.  **Rename File:** Rename it descriptively (e.g., `03_research_plan_data_product_squad.md`).
4.  **Populate TOML Frontmatter (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all placeholders (e.g., `[SquadUnitNameShort]`, `[Squad Unit Name]`, `[squad_name_tag]`) with actual values.
    *   `squad_unit_name_ref` **MUST** match the `squad_unit_name` from the corresponding `00_squad_concept_and_mission.md`.
    *   `created_date` and `last_updated` should be set to the current date/timestamp by the creating agent.
    *   Fill in optional fields like `research_coordinator_proposed`, `overall_knowledge_goal`, and `key_knowledge_domains` (summary list) if applicable, or remove them.
5.  **Define Plan in Markdown Body (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all `{{ ... }}` and `[ ... ]` placeholders with specific information.
    *   **Section 2 (Key Knowledge Domains):** Detail the critical knowledge areas and specific info/skills needed for the squad or individual members.
    *   **Section 3 (Information Gathering & Research Strategy):** For each key piece of information/skill, outline internal sources, user context, and a plan for external research (including specific questions and suggested MCP tools, Repomix, Crawl/Scrape). Ensure all paths use the `.roo/` anchor.
    *   **Section 4 (Proposed KB Structure):** Suggest how the gathered knowledge might be organized into the `skills/`, `wisdom/`, and `reference/` sections of the new modes' KBs.
    *   **Section 5 (Research Execution):** Note who is responsible for the research and conceptual timeline/deliverables.
