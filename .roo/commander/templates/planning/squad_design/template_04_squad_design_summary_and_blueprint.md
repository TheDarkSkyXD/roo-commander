# Squad Design Summary & Blueprint: {{ squad_unit_name | default: "[Squad Unit Name]" }}

## 1. Overview & Purpose of this Blueprint üìú

*   **Squad Unit:** `{{ squad_unit_name | default: "[Squad Unit Name]" }}`
*   **Proposed Managing Mode:** `{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug | default: "[manager-slug]" }}`
*   **Purpose:** This document serves as a consolidated summary and final blueprint for the design of the `{{ squad_unit_name }}`. It synthesizes key information from the detailed planning documents (Concept & Mission, Squad Member Roles, Workflow & Artifact Flow, and Knowledge & Research Plan), all of which **MUST** be linked below.
*   **Next Step:** Upon approval, this blueprint guides the actual development of the Manager mode (`{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}`), its Squad Member modes, their respective rules in `[.roo/rules-[mode_slug]/]`, and their Knowledge Bases in `[.roo/commander/modes/[mode_slug]/kb/]`.

## 2. Links to Detailed Planning Documents üîó

This summary is based on the following detailed planning documents. These documents contain the full specifications and **MUST** be consulted for complete details. All paths are workspace-root-relative.

*   **Squad Concept & Mission:** `{{ linked_squad_concept_doc | default: "[.roo/path/to/00_squad_concept_and_mission.md]" }}`
*   **Squad Member Role Definitions:**
    *   `{{ linked_squad_member_role_docs[0] | default: "[.roo/path/to/Role_Doc_1.md]" }}`
    *   `{{ linked_squad_member_role_docs[1] | default: "[.roo/path/to/Role_Doc_2.md]" }}`
    *   *(List all role definition documents. Ensure these are actual files created from template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md)*
*   **Squad Workflow & Artifact Flow:** `{{ linked_workflow_doc | default: "[.roo/path/to/02_squad_workflow_and_artifact_flow.md]" }}`
*   **Squad Knowledge & Research Plan:** `{{ linked_research_plan_doc | default: "[.roo/path/to/03_squad_knowledge_and_research_plan.md]" }}`

## 3. Executive Summary of the Squad Unit üöÄ

### 3.1. Mission & Value Proposition
*   `[Summarize the core mission and value proposition from the linked Concept & Mission document. What problem does this unit solve, and what key benefits does it provide?]`
*   *(Corresponds to `overall_mission_summary` in TOML if used)*

### 3.2. Primary Output / Deliverable of the Squad's Workflow
*   `[State the main tangible output of this squad unit's entire workflow, as defined in the Workflow document and Concept & Mission document.]`
*   *(Corresponds to `key_workflow_output` in TOML if used)*

## 4. Squad Composition Summary üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

[Provide a table summarizing the proposed squad members, their slugs, and their core responsibilities. This is a condensed view from all the linked `01_squad_member_role_definition.md` files.]

| Proposed Mode Name                      | Proposed Slug                         | Core Responsibility within Squad Workflow                     | Primary Output Artifact Type(s)        |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `[Name of Squad Member 1]`              | `[squad_member_1_slug]`               | `[1-sentence summary of responsibility]`                      | `[e.g., product_strategy.md]`          |
| `[Name of Squad Member 2]`              | `[squad_member_2_slug]`               | `[1-sentence summary of responsibility]`                      | `[e.g., poc_ideation.md]`              |
| ...                                     | ...                                   | ...                                                           | ...                                    |
| `[Name of Final Squad Member]`          | `[squad_member_N_slug]`               | `[1-sentence summary of responsibility]`                      | `[e.g., data_product_poc_plan.md]`     |

*   **Total Squad Members Proposed:** `{{ number_of_squad_members | default: "[Number based on linked role docs]" }}`

## 5. Workflow & Artifact Flow Overview üîÑ

[Provide a high-level summary of the squad's operational sequence. The Mermaid diagram from the linked Workflow document (`{{ linked_workflow_doc }}`) can be embedded or referenced here. Briefly describe the main phases and critical handoffs.]

**Visual Flow (Refer to detailed diagram in `{{ linked_workflow_doc }}`):**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Start: Manager Task for {{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}"] --> B["{{squad_member_1_slug_placeholder}}"];
    B -- Artifact 1 --> C["{{squad_member_2_slug_placeholder}}"];
    C -- Artifact 2 --> D["..."];
    D -- Artifact N-1 --> E["{{squad_member_N_slug_placeholder}}"];
    E -- {{ key_workflow_output | default: "Final Output" }} --> F["End: Consolidated Deliverable for Manager"];
```
*(Replace placeholders like `{{squad_member_1_slug_placeholder}}` with actual proposed slugs when instantiating)*

## 6. Key Knowledge & Research Requirements Summary üìö

[Summarize the most critical knowledge domains and research activities identified in the linked Knowledge & Research Plan (`{{ linked_research_plan_doc }}`). Highlight any dependencies on MCP tools or significant knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to make the squad effective.]

*   **Primary Research Focus Areas:**
    *   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[0] | default: "[Focus Area 1 from Research Plan]" }}`
    *   `{{ primary_research_focus_areas[1] | default: "[Focus Area 2 from Research Plan]" }}`
*   **Key MCP Tools Identified for Bootstrapping KB:** `[List any specific MCPs from Research Plan]`

## 7. Proposed Next Steps for Development üõ†Ô∏è

[Outline the immediate next steps based on this blueprint, assuming it is approved.]
1.  Architectural Review and Approval of this Squad Design Blueprint.
2.  Create `.mode.md` definition files for the `{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}` and all listed squad members, using the appropriate archetype templates (Manager, Squad) and information from the linked Role Definition documents.
3.  Develop core mode-specific rules in `[.roo/rules-[mode_slug]/]` for each new mode (e.g., `00-[slug]-core-principles.md`, and `01-[manager_slug]-squad-orchestration.md` for the Manager).
4.  Structure and populate initial KBs in `[.roo/commander/modes/[mode_slug]/kb/]` (READMEs, core procedures for Manager, key skills/references for Squad members) based on the Knowledge & Research Plan.
5.  Integrate the new `{{ proposed_managing_mode_slug }}` into `üëë Roo Commander`'s KB (`[.roo/commander/modes/roo-commander/kb/reference/00-available-managers-summary.md]`) and mode definition (`delegate_to` list).
6.  Begin iterative testing of the new Manager + Squad unit as per `[.roo/commander/docs/developer_guides/11_testing_and_debugging_strategies_for_modes.md]`.

This blueprint provides a comprehensive plan for developing the `{{ squad_unit_name }}`.
