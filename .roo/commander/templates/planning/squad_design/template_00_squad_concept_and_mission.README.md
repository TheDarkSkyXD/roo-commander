# Documentation: Template `template_00_squad_concept_and_mission.md`

## 1. Purpose

This template is the **starting point for designing a new "Manager + Squad" unit** within the Roo Commander V8 ecosystem. Its purpose is to define the high-level concept, mission, strategic alignment, value proposition, and intended primary output for the proposed new unit.

Filling out this document helps to clarify the "why" and "what" before diving into the details of individual squad member roles or specific workflows. It ensures that any new Manager + Squad unit has a clear purpose and aligns with broader system goals.

## 2. Usage

1.  **Initiate New Squad Design:** When a new complex capability domain is identified for Roo Commander V8 that would benefit from a dedicated Manager and specialist Squad:
    *   Create a new planning directory (e.g., `[.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/new_squad_name/](.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/new_squad_name/)`).
    *   Copy `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_00_squad_concept_and_mission.md](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_00_squad_concept_and_mission.md)` into this directory.
2.  **Rename File:** Rename the copied file descriptively (e.g., `00_concept_mission_web_app_squad.md`).
3.  **Populate TOML Frontmatter:**
    *   Fill in all placeholders in the TOML block.
    *   `id`: Unique ID for this planning document.
    *   `title`: `Squad Concept & Mission: [Full Name of New Squad Unit]`.
    *   `squad_unit_name`: The full intended name for the new unit.
    *   Define `proposed_managing_mode_slug`, `proposed_managing_mode_name`, and `primary_domain_focus`.
    *   Detail strategic alignment, problem solved, value proposition, target output, and success metrics.
    *   Add relevant `tags`.
4.  **Define Concept in Markdown Body:**
    *   Fill in all sections of the Markdown body, elaborating on the TOML fields and providing a clear narrative for the new squad unit's purpose and goals.
