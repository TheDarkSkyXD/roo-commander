# Documentation: Template `template_02_squad_workflow_and_artifact_flow.md`

## 1. Purpose

This template is used during the **Squad Planning & Design phase** to map out the **operational workflow and the flow of artifacts** for a new "Manager + Squad" unit. It details the sequence of phases, the squad member responsible for each phase, their key inputs, and their primary outputs (including conceptual target paths and templates used).

This document is critical for:
*   Designing the main orchestration procedure (e.g., `01-main-orchestration-flow.md`) for the new Manager mode's Knowledge Base.
*   Ensuring all squad members have clearly defined inputs and outputs within the overall workflow.
*   Visualizing the dependencies and handoffs within the squad's operations.
*   Providing a clear plan for how the squad will collaboratively achieve its overall objective.

## 2. Usage

1.  **Context:** This template is typically used after `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_00_squad_concept_and_mission.md]` (defining the squad's overall purpose) and multiple instances of `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md]` (defining each member) have been drafted.
2.  **Copy Template:**
    *   An agent (like `architect-squad-designer`) or a human developer will copy `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_02_squad_workflow_and_artifact_flow.md](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_02_squad_workflow_and_artifact_flow.md)` into the new squad's planning directory.
3.  **Rename File:** Rename it descriptively (e.g., `02_workflow_data_product_squad.md`).
4.  **Populate TOML Frontmatter (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all placeholders (e.g., `[SquadUnitNameShort]`, `[Squad Unit Name]`, `[squad_name_tag]`, `[manager-slug]`) with actual values.
    *   `squad_unit_name_ref` **MUST** match the `squad_unit_name` from the corresponding `00_squad_concept_and_mission.md`.
    *   `workflow_name` and `estimated_total_phases` are **REQUIRED**.
    *   `created_date` and `last_updated` should be set to the current date/timestamp by the creating agent.
    *   Fill in optional "Key Workflow Characteristics" fields if applicable, or remove them.
5.  **Define Workflow in Markdown Body (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all `{{ ... }}` and `[ ... ]` placeholders with specific information for this squad's workflow.
    *   **Crucially, customize Section 3 ("Sequential Phase Breakdown & Artifact Flow")** to detail each phase of *this specific squad's workflow*. For each phase, specify the responsible squad member slug, their inputs (linking to outputs of previous phases), key activities, and primary output artifacts (including conceptual target filenames, `.roo/` anchored paths, and paths to templates they use).
    *   Create a conceptual diagram (e.g., using Mermaid JS) in Section 4, replacing placeholder slugs.
    *   Detail key dependencies and handoff considerations in Section 5.
