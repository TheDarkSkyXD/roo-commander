# Documentation: Template `template_04_squad_design_summary_and_blueprint.md`

## 1. Purpose

This template is used during the **Squad Planning & Design phase** to create a **Squad Design Summary & Blueprint document**. This is the culminating document of the planning process, designed to:

*   Consolidate and summarize key information from all previously filled-out planning templates:
    *   `template_00_squad_concept_and_mission.md`
    *   Multiple `template_01_squad_member_role_definition.md` files
    *   `template_02_squad_workflow_and_artifact_flow.md`
    *   `template_03_squad_knowledge_and_research_plan.md`
*   Provide a single, high-level overview of the proposed new "Manager + Squad" unit.
*   Serve as a final review and approval document before actual development of the new modes, rules, and KBs begins.
*   Act as a guiding blueprint for the development team, particularly for modes like `meta-mode-developer`.

## 2. Usage

1.  **Context:** This template is used *after* all other squad planning documents (Concept/Mission, Role Definitions, Workflow, Research Plan) have been drafted and are reasonably stable.
2.  **Copy Template:**
    *   An agent (like `architect-squad-designer`) or a human developer will copy `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_04_squad_design_summary_and_blueprint.md](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/template_04_squad_design_summary_and_blueprint.md)` into the new squad's planning directory.
3.  **Rename File:** Rename it descriptively (e.g., `04_blueprint_data_product_squad.md`).
4.  **Populate TOML Frontmatter (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all placeholders (e.g., `[SquadUnitNameShort]`, `[Squad Unit Name]`, `[squad_name_tag]`) with actual values.
    *   `squad_unit_name` **MUST** match the name used in other planning docs.
    *   **Crucially, populate `linked_squad_concept_doc`, `linked_squad_member_role_docs`, `linked_workflow_doc`, and `linked_research_plan_doc`** with the correct, full `.roo/` anchored paths to all the detailed planning documents this summary is based on.
    *   `created_date` and `last_updated` should be set to the current date/timestamp by the creating agent.
    *   Fill in optional summary fields in TOML (`overall_mission_summary`, `number_of_squad_members`, etc.) by extracting key information from the linked documents, or remove these optional fields.
5.  **Synthesize Content in Markdown Body (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all `{{ ... }}` and `[ ... ]` placeholders with specific information.
    *   **Section 2 (Links to Detailed Planning Docs):** Ensure all links are correct and use the `.roo/` anchor.
    *   **Sections 3-6:** Carefully summarize the key information from the detailed planning documents. The goal is a concise overview; readers should refer to the linked detailed documents for specifics.
    *   **Section 7 (Proposed Next Steps):** Outline the path from this blueprint to actual development, referencing relevant developer guides.
