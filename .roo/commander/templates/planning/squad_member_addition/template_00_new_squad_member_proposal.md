# Proposal: Add New Squad Member '{{ proposed_new_member_name | default: "[Proposed New Member Name]" }}'
## To Squad Managed by: `{{ existing_manager_slug | default: "[Existing Manager Slug]" }}` ({{ existing_squad_name | default: "[Existing Squad Name]" }})

## 1. Introduction & Justification üéØ

*   **Proposal Date:** `{{ created_date }}`
*   **Reason for Proposal:** `{{ reason_for_proposal | default: "[State the primary driver for needing this new squad member role.]" }}`
*   **Primary Justification for New Role:** `{{ primary_justification_for_new_role | default: "[Elaborate on the problem this new role solves or the capability gap it fills within the existing squad. Why is this addition necessary or beneficial?]" }}`

## 2. Proposed New Squad Member Role Definition üë§

### 2.1. Proposed Mode Name & Slug
*   **Name:** `{{ proposed_new_member_name | default: "[Proposed Human-Friendly Name with Emoji]" }}`
*   **Slug:** `{{ proposed_new_member_slug | default: "[proposed-slug-for-new-member]" }}`
*   **Proposed Classification:** `squad` (This is standard for new squad members)

### 2.2. Core Responsibility & Domain Focus
*   `[Describe in detail the primary responsibilities and the specific domain of expertise for this new squad member. What unique tasks will it perform? What value will it add to the existing squad's workflow? This section should contain enough detail to inform its future .mode.md `roleDefinition`.]`

### 2.3. Primary Output Artifact(s)
*   **Description:** `[Describe the main tangible deliverable(s) this new mode will produce.]`
*   **Format/Template:** `[Specify the format and, if applicable, the primary template it will use for its output (e.g., path to a new or existing design artifact template, using .roo/ anchor). Example: '.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/visualizations/template_dashboard_component.md']`
*   **Example Output:** `[Brief example or description of what its output would look like.]`

### 2.4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required
*   `[List essential skills, technologies, or domain knowledge this new mode must possess. This will inform its future KB content.]`
    *   Skill 1:
    *   Skill 2:

## 3. Integration into Existing Squad Workflow üîÑ

### 3.1. Placement in Workflow Sequence
*   `[Describe precisely where this new squad member fits into the existing workflow orchestrated by the '{{ existing_manager_slug }}' mode. Does it replace an existing step, augment a step, run in parallel, or add a new sequential step? Refer to the Manager's current 'kb/procedures/01-main-orchestration-flow.md' (using its full .roo/ path).]`
*   **Expected Placement:** `{{ expected_placement_in_workflow | default: "[Describe placement clearly]" }}`

### 3.2. Input Artifacts Required by New Member
*   `[What specific artifacts (outputs from other existing squad members or the Manager) will this new mode require as input to perform its function? Be specific about source mode/role and artifact name/type, using .roo/ paths for existing artifacts if known.]`
    *   Input 1: From `[Source Mode Slug/Role]` - `[Artifact Name/Type or Path]`
    *   Input 2: ...

### 3.3. Output Artifacts & Downstream Consumers
*   `[What are its primary outputs (already described in 2.3)?]`
*   `[Which existing (or potentially new) squad members will consume these outputs? How will these outputs be used by them? This helps identify changes needed in subsequent squad members' tasks or the Manager's orchestration logic.]`

## 4. Impact on Existing Manager Mode (`{{ existing_manager_slug }}`) ‚öôÔ∏è

*   **Changes to Manager's Orchestration Flow (`[.roo/commander/modes/{{ existing_manager_slug }}/kb/procedures/01-main-orchestration-flow.md]`)**:
    *   `[Detail the specific modifications needed in the Manager's main KB procedure to incorporate this new role, including new delegation steps, and changes to input/output handling for adjacent squad members.]`
*   **Changes to Manager's Squad Composition Document (`[.roo/commander/modes/{{ existing_manager_slug }}/kb/reference/00-[squad_name_lc]-squad-composition.md]`)**:
    *   `[The new member will need to be added to this reference document, detailing its role, inputs, and outputs in the sequence.]`
*   **Changes to Manager's `.mode.md` (`[.roo/commander/modes/{{ existing_manager_slug }}/{{ existing_manager_slug }}.mode.md]`)**:
    *   The `delegate_to` list in the Manager's TOML metadata **MUST** be updated to include `{{ proposed_new_member_slug }}`.

## 5. Initial Knowledge & Research Plan (for the New Member) üìö

*   **Key KB `skills/` Topics to Bootstrap:**
    *   `[Skill 1 essential for this new role]`
    *   `[Skill 2 essential for this new role]`
*   **Key KB `wisdom/` Topics to Bootstrap (Optional):**
    *   `[Principle 1 relevant to this new role]`
*   **Immediate Research Needs (if any):**
    *   `[Are there any specific topics that need immediate research (potentially using MCP tools) to make this mode effective from the start?
