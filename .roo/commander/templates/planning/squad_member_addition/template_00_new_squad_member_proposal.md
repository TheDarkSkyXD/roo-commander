*   **Format/Template:** `[Specify the format and, if applicable, the primary template it will use for its output (e.g., path to a new or existing design artifact template).]`
*   **Example Output:** `[Brief example or description of what its output would look like.]`

### 2.4. Key Skills & Knowledge Required
*   `[List essential skills, technologies, or domain knowledge this new mode must possess. This will inform its future KB content.]`
    *   Skill 1
    *   Skill 2

## 3. Integration into Existing Squad Workflow

### 3.1. Placement in Workflow Sequence
*   `[Describe precisely where this new squad member fits into the existing workflow orchestrated by the '{{ existing_manager_slug }}' mode. Does it replace an existing step, augment a step, run in parallel, or add a new sequential step? Refer to the Manager's current 'kb/procedures/01-main-orchestration-flow.md'.]`
*   **Expected Placement:** `{{ expected_placement_in_workflow | default: "[Describe placement]" }}`
