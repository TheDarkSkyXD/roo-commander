# Documentation: Template `template_00_new_squad_member_proposal.md`

## 1. Purpose

This template is used during the **Squad Planning & Design phase** to create a **Proposal for Adding a New Squad Member** to an *existing* "Manager + Squad" unit. It provides a structured way to:

*   Justify the need for the new role within an existing squad.
*   Define the core responsibilities, skills, inputs, and outputs of the proposed new squad member.
*   Analyze how the new member will integrate into the existing squad's workflow.
*   Outline the necessary updates to the existing Manager mode's definition and Knowledge Base (KB).
*   Plan for the initial knowledge bootstrapping of the new member.

This template is intended for incremental expansion of existing squads, rather than designing a new squad unit from scratch (which uses the full suite of `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/]` templates).

## 2. Usage

1.  **Identify Need:** When an existing Manager + Squad unit requires a new specialization or needs to offload specific responsibilities to a new dedicated role.
2.  **Copy Template:**
    *   Copy `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_member_addition/template_00_new_squad_member_proposal.md](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_member_addition/template_00_new_squad_member_proposal.md)` into a relevant planning directory (e.g., `[.roo/commander/planning/squad_enhancements/]` or within the existing squad's planning folder).
3.  **Rename File:** Rename it descriptively (e.g., `prop_add_viz_specialist_to_dp_squad.md`).
4.  **Populate TOML Frontmatter (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all placeholders (e.g., `[ExistingManagerSlugShort]`, `[ProposedMemberSlugShort]`, `[Proposed New Member Name]`, `[Existing Manager's Squad Name]`, `[existing_manager_slug_tag]`, `[proposed_new_member_domain_tag]`) with actual values.
    *   The `id` should be unique.
    *   `existing_manager_slug` and `existing_squad_name` are **REQUIRED** to identify the target squad.
    *   `proposed_new_member_slug` and `proposed_new_member_name` are **REQUIRED**.
    *   `created_date` and `last_updated` should be set to the current date/timestamp by the creating agent.
    *   Fill in optional summary fields in TOML if desired, or remove them if details are only in Markdown.
5.  **Detail Proposal in Markdown Body (of the instance file):**
    *   Replace all `{{ ... }}` and `[ ... ]` placeholders with specific information.
    *   Elaborate on the justification (Section 1).
    *   Provide a detailed role definition for the new member (Section 2).
    *   Critically analyze its integration into the existing workflow (Section 3), referencing the Manager's current KB procedure using its full `.roo/` path.
    *   Specify the exact impacts on the existing Manager mode's configuration and KB files (Section 4), using full `.roo/` paths.
    *   Outline initial knowledge needs for the new member (Section 5).
