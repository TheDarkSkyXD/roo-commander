# Project Handoff: Roo Commander V8 - Status & Current Focus

## 1. Project & Version

*   **Project:** Roo Commander V8 + Manager-DataProduct + Workspace Maintenance Squad Planning
*   **Core Architecture:** `roo-commander` (lean orchestrator) -> `Manager Modes` (domain-specific orchestration) -> `Squad Modes` (specialist execution).
*   **Primary Interaction Model:** MDTM Task-Driven, within managed Sessions.

## 2. Date of Handoff Context

*   **Date:** `{{YYYYMMDD}}` *(Please replace with the actual date you are creating this handoff)*

## 3. Overall System Goal

To develop Roo Commander V8 as a lean, adaptable, top-level orchestrator. Its primary functions are:
*   Managing user work sessions (logging, artifact organization).
*   Delegating high-level user goals to specialized "Manager" modes by creating and assigning top-level MDTM tasks.
*   The first major capability being implemented via this architecture is the "Data Product PoC Design" workflow, managed by `manager-data-product` and its `data-product-*` squad.
*   A "Workspace Maintenance Squad," managed by `manager-workspace-maintenance`, is currently in the detailed planning phase to support the evolution and upkeep of the RCv8 ecosystem itself.

    *   *(Note: We still need to create `04_blueprint-workspace-maintenance-squad.md` to complete this set).*

## 5. Current Focus / Immediate Next Steps (Before Handoff)

*   The last file actively created was the planning document: `.roo/commander/planning/squad_designs/workspace_maintenance_squad/01-role-symbolic-language-refactor-agent.md`.
*   The immediate next step discussed was to create the **`04_blueprint-workspace-maintenance-squad.md`** to complete the planning document set for the Workspace Maintenance Squad.

## 6. Next Logical Steps (Post Re-engagement / Broader View)

1.  **Finalize Workspace Maintenance Squad Planning:**
    *   Create `04_blueprint-workspace-maintenance-squad.md`.
2.  **Implement Workspace Maintenance Squad:**
    *   Create `.mode.md`, rules, and KB files for `manager-workspace-maintenance`.
    *   Create `.mode.md`, rules, and KB files for each of its 10 squad members.
3.  **Populate Initial `skills/` & `wisdom/` KBs:**
    *   For `manager-data-product` (e.g., handoffs, risk assessment, iterative principles, user-centricity, communication).
    *   For key `data-product-*` squad members (e.g., SMART objectives for strategist, brainstorming for ideator).
    *   For key `manager-workspace-maintenance` squad members.
4.  **Update/Review Developer Guides:**
    *   Update `developer_guides/README.md` (index).
    *   Review `01_creating_new_manager_modes.md`, `02_creating_new_squad_member_modes.md`, `03_extending_roo_commander_kb.md` against new templates and architecture.
    *   Finalize `04_template_overview.md` to include all created templates.
5.  **Symbolic Language Implementation (Major Future Phase):**
    *   Finalize `PLAN-SYMOPT-GLOSSARY-001_Foundation_Glossary_v2.md`.
    *   Create `developer_guides/09_using_the_symbolic_language.md`.
    *   Begin refactoring core prompts, rules, and KBs using `symbolic-language-refactor-agent`.
6.  **Build & Release Process Implementation:**
    *   Develop the Node.js scripts (`package-release.js` and its config).
    *   Finalize and test the `01_sop_build_and_github_release.md`.
7.  **Testing & Debugging Framework:**
    *   Develop `developer_guides/11_testing_and_debugging_strategies_for_modes.md`.
    *   Implement testing procedures for core workflows.

## 7. Key Decisions Made Recently (For Quick Re-Alignment)

*   **Architecture:** Solidified "Orchestrator (`roo-commander`) -> Manager -> Squad" model.
*   **Delegation:** MDTM is the standard for all significant inter-mode tasking.
*   **Session Management:** Sessions are central for context, logging, and artifact storage (`.roo/commander/sessions/`). Artifacts (including primary design outputs) are stored within the session's `artifacts/` directory.
*   **Path Conventions:** All file path references in TOML and Markdown **MUST** be workspace-root-relative, anchored to `.roo/`.
*   **Mode-Specific Rules:** Each mode has its own `rules-[mode_slug]/` directory. The `00-[mode_slug]-core-principles.md` file in this directory now includes the mode's KB lookup logic (no separate `99-...-kb-lookup.md` file).
*   **KB Structure:** Standardized KB subfolders for modes: `README.md` (index), `prompts/`, `procedures/`, `reference/`, `examples/`, `skills/`, `wisdom/`.
*   **Templates:** Comprehensive set of templates created for modes (archetypes), rules (workspace, mode-specific core principles, manager orchestration), KB articles (README, procedure, prompt, reference, example, skill, wisdom), MDTM tasks, session logs & artifacts, squad planning, design artifacts, SOPs, changelogs, release notes, feedback summaries, dev onboarding, and testing.
*   **Tool Agnosticism in Prompts:** Mode system prompts and KB procedures should focus on *objectives* and *outcomes*, not prescribe specific tool names, allowing modes or Roo Code core to select appropriate tools.

## 8. Open Questions / Discussion Points for New Session

*   Confirm the exact details and implementation strategy for the `build_release` Node.js script and its configuration.
*   Prioritize which `skills/` and `wisdom/` KB articles to create first for `manager-data-product` and its squad.
*   Discuss the level of automation vs. guided interaction for the "Workspace Maintenance Squad" members, especially `release-process-assistant`.
