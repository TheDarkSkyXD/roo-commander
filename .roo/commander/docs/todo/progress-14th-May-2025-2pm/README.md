# Project Re-engagement Context for Roo Commander V8

## Purpose of this Directory

The files within this directory (`_project_handoff_context/` or a similar name you choose) are designed to provide a **concise and comprehensive snapshot** of the Roo Commander V8 project's status, architecture, key artifacts, and future ideas at a specific point in time.

This set of documents, intended to be used alongside a full project Repomix output and a directory tree listing, serves several key purposes:

1.  **Continuity for Developers:** Allows a developer (including your future self) to quickly regain context and resume work after a break or when switching between development environments/sessions.
2.  **AI Context Priming:** Provides a structured set of initial information that can be fed to an AI assistant (like a new instance of Roo Code) to bootstrap its understanding of the project, enabling it to become productive more quickly.
3.  **Handoff Between AI Instances:** If an AI's context window is filled, these documents can help transfer essential knowledge to a new AI instance to continue the work.
4.  **Project Archival Snapshot:** Can serve as a high-level summary if a particular development phase is being archived.

## Key Documents in this Set:

*   **`00_project_status_and_current_focus.md`:**
    *   **THE STARTING POINT.** Details the project's immediate status, last accomplishments, current focus, next logical steps, key recent decisions, and open questions. This is crucial for immediate re-engagement.

*   **`01_key_architectural_overview.md`:**
    *   Summarizes the core architectural patterns of Roo Commander V8 (Orchestrator -> Manager -> Squad), the roles of MDTM and Session Management, and pointers to key standards documents.

*   **`02_master_template_index.md`:**
    *   Provides a categorized index of all standard TOML+Markdown templates used within the Roo Commander V8 ecosystem, making it easy to find the correct blueprint for creating new components.

*   **`03_ideas_for_new_squads.md`:**
    *   A brainstorming document listing potential new "Manager + Squad" units that could extend Roo Commander V8's capabilities in the future.

*   **`04_ideas_for_new_templates.md`:**
    *   A brainstorming document for new system templates (for rules, KB articles, artifacts, etc.) that might be needed as the system evolves.

## How to Use This Context Package:

1.  **Update `00_project_status_and_current_focus.md`:** Before "pausing" work or handing off, ensure this file accurately reflects the latest state.
2.  **Generate Repomix & Tree:** Create an up-to-date Repomix XML of the relevant parts of the `.roo/` directory and a `tree` command output of the workspace.
3.  **Provide to New Context:** When starting a new session or handing off:
    *   The AI/developer should first review `00_project_status_and_current_focus.md`.
    *   Then, use the other documents (`01_key_architectural_overview.md`, `02_master_template_index.md`, etc.) as needed for deeper understanding.
    *   The Repomix output and tree file provide the detailed "code" context.

This package aims to make transitions between work sessions or development environments as seamless as possible.
