# Roo Commander V8: Brainstorming Ideas for New Manager + Squad Units

## 1. Purpose of this Document

This document serves as a living list of ideas for potential new "Manager + Squad" units that could be developed to extend the capabilities of the Roo Commander V8 ecosystem. Each idea represents a complex workflow or domain that could benefit from a dedicated Manager mode orchestrating a team of specialist Squad Member modes.

This is a brainstorming space. Ideas listed here would need to go through the formal "Squad Planning & Design" process (using templates from `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/)`) before development.

## 2. Criteria for a New Squad Unit

A new Manager + Squad unit might be considered when:
*   A complex, multi-step workflow needs to be repeatedly executed.
*   The workflow involves multiple distinct specializations or roles.
*   The capability is significant enough to warrant its own dedicated orchestrator (Manager).
*   Standardizing the process would bring significant benefits in terms of quality, efficiency, or consistency.

## 4. Next Steps for a New Squad Idea

1.  Select a promising squad idea from this list (or a new one).
2.  Initiate the "Squad Planning & Design" process using the templates in `[.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/](.roo/commander/templates/planning/squad_design/)`, starting with `template_00_squad_concept_and_mission.md`.
3.  This can be done collaboratively with `manager-workspace-maintenance` and its `architect-squad-designer` squad member.

This list is intended to be a source of inspiration and will evolve as Roo Commander V8 matures.
