# Architecture: Squad Member Modes - Specialist Executors

## 1. Introduction to Squad Member Modes

In the Roo Commander hierarchical architecture, **Squad Member modes** (classification: `squad`) are the specialist AI agents that perform the detailed, focused work within a specific domain. They operate under the direction of a "Manager" mode (e.g., `üßë‚Äçüíº Data Product Manager` (`manager-data-product`)) and are responsible for executing well-defined tasks that contribute to the Manager's overall objective.

Each Squad Member is an expert in a narrow area, such as defining product strategy, creating user personas, designing data schemas, or generating specific types of documentation. They are the "workhorses" of the "Manager + Squad" model. Their detailed operational logic is primarily defined by their assigned MDTM task, supplemented by their mode-specific rules (in `[.roo/rules-[squad_member_slug]/](.roo/rules-[squad_member_slug]/)`) and their Knowledge Base (KB) (in `[.roo/commander/modes/[squad_member_slug]/kb/](.roo/commander/modes/[squad_member_slug]/kb/)`).

## 2. Core Purpose and Philosophy

The introduction of Squad Member modes aims to:

*   **Enable Deep Specialization:** Allow individual AI modes to develop and apply deep expertise in a very specific sub-domain or task type.
*   **Promote Single Responsibility:** Each Squad Member typically has one primary function and produces one primary type of output artifact.
*   **Facilitate Granular Task Management:** Enable Managers to break down complex workflows into small, manageable, and delegable units of work via MDTM.
*   **Improve Output Quality:** By focusing on a narrow area, Squad Members can leverage more targeted knowledge (from their KBs and rules) and procedures, leading to higher-quality, more consistent outputs for their specific tasks.
*   **Simplify Mode Development:** Creating a new specialist Squad Member is generally less complex than creating a mode that tries to handle many different functions.

## 3. Key Responsibilities of a Squad Member Mode

All Squad Member modes, despite their varied specializations, share a common set of operational responsibilities centered around processing MDTM (Markdown-Driven Task Management) tasks, guided by their Core Principles rule (e.g., `[.roo/rules-data-product-strategist/00-data-product-strategist-core-principles.md]`).

### 3.1. MDTM Task Ingestion and Understanding
*   **Receive Sub-Task:** A Squad Member is activated when it receives an MDTM task assigned by its Manager mode.
*   **Thoroughly Read Task:** It **MUST** read and fully understand its assigned MDTM task file, paying close attention to:
    *   The `title`, `description` (goal of this specific task).
    *   The `acceptance_criteria` for its work.
    *   The detailed `checklist / sub-tasks` it needs to perform.
    *   Any `input_artifacts` (e.g., outputs from previous Squad Members, identified by their `.roo/` anchored paths) it needs to use.
    *   The expected `output_artifacts` it needs to produce (including target `.roo/` anchored paths).

### 3.2. Specialized Task Execution
*   **Follow Checklist:** Methodically execute the steps outlined in its MDTM task's `checklist`.
*   **Apply Expertise:** Utilize its specialized knowledge (guided by its rules and KB, particularly `skills/` or `wisdom/` sections) to perform its designated function (e.g., strategic analysis, persona development, data modeling).
*   **Create Primary Output Artifact:** Generate its primary deliverable, which is typically a structured TOML+Markdown document using a predefined template (e.g., `data-product-strategist` uses `[.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_product_strategy.md](.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_product_strategy.md)`). This artifact **MUST** be saved to the workspace-root-relative path specified or implied by its MDTM task (e.g., `[.roo/commander/sessions/[SESSION_ID]/artifacts/design_outputs/[ProductName]/[artifact_name].md]`).

### 3.3. MDTM Task File Updates (Mandatory)
As a Squad Member works on its assigned MDTM task, it **MUST** continuously update its own task file as per `[.roo/rules/02-mdtm-task-standard.md](.roo/rules/02-mdtm-task-standard.md)`:
*   Mark `checklist` items as complete (`- [ ]` to `- [‚úÖ]`).
*   Append detailed progress, observations, any issues encountered, or significant actions taken to the `Log Entries / Notes ü™µ` section of its MDTM task file, including ISO 8601 UTC timestamps.
*   Upon completion of its primary deliverable, add the workspace-root-relative path(s) to its created output artifact(s) to the `output_artifacts` array in the TOML frontmatter of its MDTM task file.
*   Update the `status` field in its MDTM task's TOML (e.g., to `"üü¢ Done"`, `"üî¥ Error"`, `"‚ö™ Blocked"`).
*   Regularly update the `updated_date` field (ISO 8601 UTC format) in its MDTM task's TOML.

### 3.4. Reporting to Manager
*   Once its assigned MDTM task is fully completed (all checklist items done, acceptance criteria met, output artifact created and linked) or if it encounters an unrecoverable error or an insurmountable blocker, it **MUST** report its final status (referencing its MDTM Task ID) back to its `coordinator` (the Manager mode). This is typically done by updating its MDTM task and the Manager monitoring it.
*   Error reporting **MUST** follow `[.roo/commander/docs/standards/09-error-handling-and-reporting-standard.md](.roo/commander/docs/standards/09-error-handling-and-reporting-standard.md)`.

### 3.5. Session Context Awareness
*   Squad Members operate within the context of the work session initiated by `üëë Roo Commander` and passed down through their Manager. All artifacts they create **MUST** be part of this session and use workspace-root-relative paths, typically within the session's `artifacts/` directory.

## 4. Example: The `data-product-*` Squad

The `üßë‚Äçüíº Data Product Manager` (`manager-data-product`) directs a squad of specialist modes to execute the Data Product Design PoC Workflow. Each member has a distinct role:

*   **`üìä Data Product Strategist` (`data-product-strategist`):**
    *   **Receives:** MDTM task from `manager-data-product` with the high-level PoC goal.
    *   **Executes:** Defines vision, objectives, target audience.
    *   **Produces:** `product_strategy.md` (using `[.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_product_strategy.md](.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_product_strategy.md)`).
    *   **Updates MDTM Task:** Logs progress, links output, sets status to `"üü¢ Done"`.
*   **`üí° Data Product Ideator` (`data-product-ideator`):**
    *   **Receives:** MDTM task with `product_strategy.md` as input.
    *   **Executes:** Brainstorms PoC features, defines scope.
    *   **Produces:** `poc_ideation.md` (using `[.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_poc_ideation.md](.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_poc_ideation.md)`).
*   **`üë§ Data Product UX Persona Architect` (`data-product-ux-persona-architect`):**
    *   **Receives:** MDTM task with `poc_ideation.md` as input.
    *   **Executes:** Develops detailed user personas.
    *   **Produces:** One or more `user_persona_[name].md` files (using `[.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_user_persona.md](.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_user_persona.md)`).
*   **`üîß Data Product Simulated Data Designer` (`data-product-simdata-designer`):**
    *   **Receives:** MDTM task with `poc_ideation.md` and persona documents as input.
    *   **Executes:** Defines data schema, describes/generates simulated data.
    *   **Produces:** `simulated_data_schema.md` (using `[.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_simulated_data_schema.md](.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_simulated_data_schema.md)`) and an associated data file (e.g., `.csv`).
*   **`üé® Data Product PoC Interface Architect` (`data-product-poc-interface-architect`):**
    *   **Receives:** MDTM task with personas and data schema/sample data as input.
    *   **Executes:** Designs conceptual UI/UX for the PoC.
    *   **Produces:** `poc_interface_design.md` (using `[.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_poc_interface_design.md](.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_poc_interface_design.md)`).
*   **`üìù Data Product PoC Documenter & Planner` (`data-product-poc-documenter`):**
    *   **Receives:** MDTM task with ALL previous artifacts as input.
    *   **Executes:** Consolidates inputs into the final PoC plan.
    *   **Produces:** `data_product_poc_plan.md` (using `[.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_data_product_poc_plan.md](.roo/commander/templates/design_artifacts/data_product/template_data_product_poc_plan.md)`).

This sequential execution, managed by `manager-data-product`, ensures each specialist contributes its expertise to build a comprehensive final deliverable.

## 5. Key Characteristics of Squad Member Modes

*   **Highly Specialized:** Focused on a narrow set of tasks and one primary output type.
*   **Task-Driven:** Their operation is almost entirely defined by the MDTM task they receive.
*   **Artifact Producers:** Their main contribution is a well-defined, structured artifact.
*   **Minimal Internal Orchestration Logic:** Complex sequencing is handled by their Manager; Squad Members primarily follow their MDTM task's checklist and their mode-specific rules/KB.
*   **Lean KBs (Potentially):** While they have a standard KB structure, their KBs might initially be minimal, containing primarily references to their output templates or core skills/wisdom if their task is highly specialized and requires codified domain knowledge beyond the MDTM checklist.

Squad Member modes are the fundamental building blocks for executing detailed work within the Roo Commander architecture, enabling depth of expertise and modularity.
