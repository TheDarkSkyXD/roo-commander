# Architecture: Session Management & Artifacts - Context and Traceability

## 1. Introduction: The Concept of a "Session"

In Roo Commander V8, a **Session** represents a distinct period of interaction between a user and the system, typically focused on achieving a specific high-level goal or completing a significant phase of work (e.g., "Design the Initial PoC for Project Alpha," "Refine User Personas for Q3 Campaign").

The Session Management system is a core architectural component designed to:
*   **Preserve Context:** Capture all relevant information, discussions, decisions, and generated files related to a particular work effort.
*   **Ensure Traceability:** Provide a clear, chronological record of activities and delegations.
*   **Facilitate Continuity:** Allow work to be paused, resumed, and handed off effectively.
*   **Organize Work Products:** Keep all files related to a specific goal grouped together.

## 2. Core Components of Session Management

The system revolves around a few key components, governed by the workspace standard `.roo/rules/03-session-management-standard.md`:

### 2.1. Session Directory
*   **Structure:** Each session is housed in its own dedicated directory within the workspace.
*   **Location:** `.roo/commander/sessions/`
*   **Naming:** `SESSION-[SanitizedGoal]-[YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS]` (e.g., `SESSION-DataProductPoC_Alpha-20250715-103000`)
*   **Purpose:** Acts as the top-level container for all information related to that specific work session.

### 2.2. Session Log (`session_log.md`)
*   **Location:** Directly within the Session Directory (e.g., `SESSION-DataProductPoC_Alpha-20250715-103000/session_log.md`).
*   **Format:** A TOML+Markdown file based on `.roo/commander/templates/sessions/template_00_mdtm_session_generic.md`.
*   **Purpose:** This is the central, chronological narrative of the session. It records:
    *   **Session Metadata (TOML):** Unique `id` (SessionID), `title` (goal), `status` (Active, Paused, Completed, Error), `start_time`, `end_time`, `coordinator` mode (`roo-commander`).
    *   **Links to MDTM Tasks (TOML `related_tasks`):** IDs of top-level MDTM tasks initiated by `roo-commander` during this session (e.g., the main task assigned to a Manager mode).
    *   **Links to Session Artifacts (TOML `related_artifacts`):** Relative paths to all significant contextual files and key deliverables created or referenced during the session (see below).
    *   **Log Entries (Markdown):** Timestamped entries detailing key events, user interactions, decisions made by `roo-commander`, delegations to Manager modes, and critical outcomes.

### 2.3. Session Artifacts Directory (`artifacts/`)
*   **Location:** A subdirectory within each Session Directory (e.g., `SESSION-DataProductPoC_Alpha-20250715-103000/artifacts/`).
*   **Purpose:** To store all supporting files, notes, learnings, research findings, code snippets, and crucially, the **key design deliverables** produced by Manager and Squad modes during the session.
*   **Standardized Substructure (Scaffold):** Upon session initiation, a standard set of subdirectories is created within `artifacts/` to help organize different types of information. This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   `notes/`: General ad-hoc notes.
    *   `learnings/`: Key insights or solutions discovered.
    *   `questions/`: Questions raised for later resolution.
    *   `design_outputs/`: **This is where primary deliverables from workflows like Data Product Design (e.g., `product_strategy.md`, `poc_ideation.md`, `data_product_poc_plan.md`) are stored**, often within a further project-specific subfolder (e.g., `design_outputs/PROJECT_ALPHA/`).
    *   `summaries/`: Stores session summary documents if generated.
    *   Other folders like `research/`, `blockers/`, `context/`, `snippets/`, etc., as defined in the scaffold.
*   Each subdirectory within the scaffold contains a `README.md` explaining its purpose and expected content/naming conventions.

## 3. How Sessions Provide Context and Traceability

### 3.1. Contextual Grouping
*   By containing all logs, notes, and work products related to a specific goal within a single session directory, the system ensures that context is not lost or scattered across the workspace.
*   When resuming a session, `roo-commander` (and potentially other modes) can quickly re-establish context by reviewing the `session_log.md` and key artifacts.

### 3.2. Chronological Record
*   The `session_log.md` provides a timestamped narrative of the interaction, showing the sequence of events, decisions, and delegations. This is invaluable for understanding how a particular outcome was reached.

### 3.3. Linking Work Units
*   The `related_tasks` field in the `session_log.md` links the session directly to the high-level MDTM tasks managed by `roo-commander`.
*   The `related_artifacts` field links the session log to all supporting documentation and key deliverables created during that session.
*   MDTM task files themselves contain `parent_task_id` and `input_artifacts`/`output_artifacts` fields, creating a further web of traceable relationships between work items.

### 3.4. Supporting Asynchronous Work and Handoffs
*   A well-documented session (via its log and artifacts) can be easily paused and resumed later by the same user or even handed off to another user or a different AI orchestrator (in more advanced scenarios). The session directory contains all the necessary information to get up to speed.

### 3.5. Auditability
*   The entire structure provides a robust audit trail, which can be important for project reviews, quality assurance, or understanding the history of a project's development.

## 4. Session Lifecycle Management

`roo-commander` is responsible for managing the lifecycle of sessions, including:

*   **Initiation:** Creating new sessions when a new high-level goal is undertaken.
*   **Activation:** Setting a session as "active" so that all subsequent logging and artifact creation occurs within its context.
*   **Pausing & Resuming:** Allowing users to temporarily halt and later continue work on a session.
*   **Summarization:** (Potentially) Generating concise summaries of session activities and outcomes.
*   **Completion/Ending:** Formally closing out a session when its objectives are met or it is otherwise concluded.

## 5. Conclusion

The Session Management system is a cornerstone of Roo Commander V8's architecture. By providing a standardized and structured way to capture, organize, and link all aspects of a user's interaction around a specific goal, it greatly enhances context preservation, traceability, and the overall manageability of complex, AI-driven workflows. The `artifacts/` directory, particularly `artifacts/design_outputs/`, becomes the repository for the valuable deliverables produced by the system.
