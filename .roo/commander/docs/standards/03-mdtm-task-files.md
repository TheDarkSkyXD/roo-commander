# Standard: Understanding MDTM Task Files

## 1. Introduction to MDTM Tasks

In Roo Commander V8, **MDTM (Markdown-Driven Task Management)** is the primary system for delegating work, tracking progress, and ensuring clarity in complex workflows. When `roo-commander` assigns a high-level goal to a "Manager" mode, or when a "Manager" mode assigns a specific piece of work to one of its "Squad Members," this is done using an MDTM task file.

These task files are structured documents using the TOML+Markdown format (see `[./02-toml-md-document-format.md](./02-toml-md-document-format.md)`). Understanding their structure is key to seeing how work is defined, executed, and tracked.

This guide explains the standard structure of an MDTM task file, based on:
*   The generic template: `[.roo/commander/templates/tasks/template_00_mdtm_task_generic.md](.././/templates/tasks/template_00_mdtm_task_generic.md)`
*   The formal workspace rule: `[.roo/rules/02-mdtm-task-standard.md](.././/rules/02-mdtm-task-standard.md)`

## 2. Anatomy of an MDTM Task File

An MDTM task file has two main parts:

1.  **TOML Frontmatter (Metadata):** Contains structured information about the task.
2.  **Markdown Body (Details & Progress):** Contains human-readable descriptions, acceptance criteria, a checklist of actions, and a log of activities.

### 2.1. Key TOML Frontmatter Fields Explained

The TOML section (between the `+++` delimiters at the top of the file) holds crucial metadata:

*   **`id` (String, Required):**
    *   A unique identifier for this specific task (e.g., `TASK-MDP-20250716-103000`). It matches the core part of the task's filename.
*   **`title` (String, Required):**
    *   A concise, human-readable title describing the task's main objective.
    *   *Example:* `"Orchestrate: Design Data Product PoC for Project Alpha"`
*   **`status` (String, Required):**
    *   The current state of the task. This is updated by the assigned mode as it works.
    *   **Common Values:**
        *   `"üü° To Do"`: Task is created but not yet started.
        *   `"üîµ In Progress"`: Task is actively being worked on.
        *   `"üü¢ Done"`: Task is successfully completed, all acceptance criteria met.
        *   `"üî¥ Error"`: Task encountered an unrecoverable error.
        *   `"‚ö™ Blocked"`: Progress is impeded by an external factor.
        *   `"üü£ Review"`: (Optional) Work is complete and awaiting review.
*   **`type` (String, Required):**
    *   Categorizes the task.
    *   *Examples:* `"‚öôÔ∏è Task"` (generic), `"üåü Feature"`, `"üêû BugFix"`, `"üìñ Documentation"`, `"üìä DataProductDesignPhase"`.
*   **`priority` (String, Required):**
    *   Indicates the urgency.
    *   *Examples:* `"üö® Critical"`, `"üüß High"`, `"‚ñ∂Ô∏è Medium"`, `"üîΩ Low"`.
*   **`created_date` (String, Required):**
    *   Timestamp (ISO 8601 format) of when the task was created.
*   **`updated_date` (String, Required):**
    *   Timestamp (ISO 8601 format) of the last significant update (especially status changes or log entries).
*   `due_date` (String, Optional):
    *   Target completion date (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
*   **`assigned_to` (String, Required):**
    *   The slug of the AI mode (e.g., `manager-data-product`, `data-product-strategist`) responsible for executing this task.
*   **`coordinator` (String, Required):**
    *   The slug of the AI mode (e.g., `roo-commander`) or the MDTM Task ID of the parent task that delegated/created this task. This shows who is waiting for this task's completion.
*   `parent_task_id` (String, Optional):
    *   If this task is a sub-task of another MDTM task, this field contains the `id` of that parent task, creating a hierarchy.
*   `input_artifacts` (Array of Strings, Optional):
    *   A list of file paths (relative to the workspace root or a session's `artifacts/` root) that are necessary inputs for this task.
    *   *Example:* `[".roo/commander/sessions/SESSION_XYZ/artifacts/design_outputs/product_strategy_v1.md"]`
*   `output_artifacts` (Array of Strings, Optional):
    *   A list of file paths for the primary deliverables created or modified by this task. This is usually populated by the `assigned_to` mode upon completion.
    *   *Example:* `[".roo/commander/sessions/SESSION_XYZ/artifacts/design_outputs/AlphaPoC/poc_ideation_v1.md"]`
*   `related_docs` (Array of Strings, Optional):
    *   Links to other relevant documents, specifications, ADRs, or external URLs that provide context.
*   `tags` (Array of Strings, Required):
    *   Keywords for searching and filtering. Always includes `"mdtm"`.
    *   *Example:* `["mdtm", "data-product", "ideation-phase"]`
*   `template_schema_doc` (String, Required):
    *   Always points to `".roo/commander/templates/tasks/template_00_mdtm_task_generic.README.md"`.

### 2.2. Key Markdown Body Sections Explained

Following the TOML frontmatter, the Markdown body details the "what" and "how" of the task, and tracks its execution:

*   **`# Task: {{ title }}` (Main Heading):**
    *   Repeats the task title for human readability.

*   **`## 1. Description ‚úçÔ∏è`**:
    *   **Goal:** A clear statement of what the task aims to achieve.
    *   **Context:** Background information explaining why the task is needed.
    *   **Scope:** Defines the boundaries of the task ‚Äì what's included and what's not.

*   **`## 2. Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ`**:
    *   A list of specific, measurable conditions that must be met for the task to be considered "üü¢ Done". These are crucial for verifying completion.
    *   Usually formatted as a GFM checklist (e.g., `- [ ] Deliverable X is created and matches specification Y.`).

*   **`## 3. Checklist / Sub-Tasks üìù`**:
    *   This is the **action plan** for the `assigned_to` mode. It's a detailed, step-by-step list of actions the mode needs to perform.
    *   **Format:** Uses GFM checklists:
        *   `- [ ] Action item 1 for the AI mode.`
        *   `- [ ] Action item 2, possibly with sub-steps.`
    *   **Updates:** The assigned AI mode **MUST** update these checklist items as it completes them, changing `- [ ]` to `- [‚úÖ]`. This provides a real-time view of progress.

*   **`## 4. Log Entries / Notes ü™µ`**:
    *   This section is an **append-only log** maintained by the `assigned_to` mode during task execution.
    *   The mode records:
        *   When it starts the task.
        *   Confirmation of completing checklist items.
        *   Any significant observations or decisions made.
        *   Errors encountered and how they were handled (or if they are blocking).
        *   Paths to any temporary files created or tools used.
    *   Each entry should ideally be timestamped (ISO 8601 format) and attributed to the mode.
    *   *Example:*
        ```
        *   `2025-07-16T10:05:00Z - data-product-strategist: Task ingested. Reviewing input artifacts.`
        *   `2025-07-16T10:15:00Z - data-product-strategist: Completed checklist item 1: Discussed initial PoC idea.`
        ```

## 3. How MDTM Tasks Drive the Workflow

1.  **Creation & Delegation:** A Coordinator/Manager mode creates an MDTM task file, populating the TOML and initial Markdown sections (Description, AC, Checklist). It then informs the `assigned_to` mode about this task file.
2.  **Execution & Updates:** The `assigned_to` mode reads the task, executes the checklist, updates the checklist status, appends to its log, and updates its TOML `status` and `output_artifacts` within the task file.
3.  **Monitoring:** The Coordinator/Manager mode can read the MDTM task file at any time to see the latest status, checklist progress, and log entries.
4.  **Completion:** When the `assigned_to` mode finishes, it marks the task "üü¢ Done" (or another final status) and reports back to its Coordinator.

This system ensures that all work is clearly defined, progress is visible, and outcomes are documented in a standardized way. Understanding the structure of these MDTM task files is key to understanding how Roo Commander V8 manages complex projects.
