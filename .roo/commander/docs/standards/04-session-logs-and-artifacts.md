# Standard: Understanding Session Logs & Artifacts

## 1. Introduction: What are Roo Commander V8 Sessions?

When you work with Roo Commander V8 on a specific goal or project phase (like designing a Data Product PoC), all related activities, discussions, decisions, and generated files are organized within a **Session**. Think of a session as a dedicated work envelope or a project diary for a particular objective.

The Session Management system is designed to:
*   Keep your work organized.
*   Ensure all important information is captured and easy to find.
*   Provide a clear history (traceability) of how results were achieved.
*   Allow you to pause and resume work effectively.

This guide explains the key components of a session: the `session_log.md` and the `artifacts/` directory. This system is formally defined in the workspace rule: `[.roo/rules/03-session-management-standard.md](.././/rules/03-session-management-standard.md)`.

## 2. The Session Directory: Your Work Hub

Each session gets its own unique directory.
*   **Location:** All session directories are stored within `.roo/commander/sessions/`.
*   **Naming:** They follow the pattern `SESSION-[YourGoal]-[Timestamp]`, for example:
    `SESSION-DataProductPoC_WebAppAnalytics-20250716-140000`

Inside this main session directory, you'll find two primary items:

1.  `session_log.md` (The Session Log)
2.  `artifacts/` (The Session Artifacts Directory)

## 3. The Session Log (`session_log.md`)

This is the central narrative and index for your session.

*   **File:** `session_log.md`
*   **Location:** Directly inside your session directory.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a chronological record of key events, decisions, and links to important files created or used during the session.
*   **Format:** It's a TOML+Markdown file (see `[./02-toml-md-document-format.md](./02-toml-md-document-format.md)`).

### Key Information in `session_log.md` (TOML Frontmatter):

*   **`id`:** The unique Session ID (matches the directory name).
*   **`title`:** The goal or title you provided when the session started.
*   **`status`:** The current state of the session (e.g., `"üü¢ Active"`, `"‚è∏Ô∏è Paused"`, `"üèÅ Completed"`).
*   **`start_time` / `end_time`:** When the session began and ended/paused.
*   **`coordinator`:** The AI mode that initiated and is managing the session (usually `roo-commander`).
*   **`related_tasks` (Array):** Lists the IDs of any top-level MDTM task files (from `.roo/commander/tasks/`) that were initiated by `roo-commander` during this session. For example, the main task assigned to `manager-data-product`.
*   **`related_artifacts` (Array):** This is a crucial list of **relative paths** to all important files stored within this session's `artifacts/` directory. This includes notes, learnings, and key design deliverables. Paths are relative from the session directory root (e.g., `artifacts/notes/NOTE-InitialIdeas-20250716-140500.md`).
*   **`tags` (Array):** Keywords relevant to the session's goal.

### Log Entries in `session_log.md` (Markdown Body):

*   Below the TOML frontmatter, under `## Log Entries`, you'll find a timestamped list of significant events. This includes:
    *   When the session was started, paused, resumed, or ended.
    *   Key prompts from `roo-commander` and your significant responses.
    *   When `roo-commander` delegates a major task (like starting a Data Product Design workflow) to a Manager mode, including the MDTM Task ID.
    *   When significant artifacts (especially key deliverables) are created and saved, along with their paths.
    *   Any critical errors or important decisions made at the `roo-commander` level.

**Think of the `session_log.md` as the captain's log for your work session.**

## 4. Session Artifacts (The `artifacts/` Directory)

This is where all the "stuff" you and the AI modes create or reference during the session is stored.

*   **Location:** `[YourSessionDirectory]/artifacts/`
*   **Purpose:** To provide a structured repository for all supporting documents, notes, research, code snippets, and, most importantly, the **final design deliverables** produced by the workflows (like the Data Product PoC Plan).

### Standard Subdirectories within `artifacts/`:

When `roo-commander` initiates a new session, it sets up a standard "scaffold" of subdirectories within `artifacts/` to help keep things organized. Each of these subdirectories will contain its own `README.md` explaining its specific purpose. Common and important ones include:

*   **`design_outputs/`**:
    *   **This is a key folder!** It's the primary location where the main deliverables from complex design workflows (like those managed by `manager-data-product`) are stored.
    *   You might find further subfolders here named after your specific project or PoC (e.g., `design_outputs/WebApp_Analytics_PoC/`).
    *   Files like `product_strategy.md`, `poc_ideation.md`, `user_persona_*.md`, `simulated_data_schema.md`, `poc_interface_design.md`, and the final `data_product_poc_plan.md` will typically reside here.
*   **`notes/`**: For general, ad-hoc notes, meeting minutes, or quick observations made during the session. (Uses `template_00_session_note.md`).
*   **`learnings/`**: For documenting key insights, solutions to problems, or "aha!" moments. (Uses `template_00_session_learning.md`).
*   **`questions/`**: For specific questions raised during the session that need answers or further investigation. (Uses `template_00_session_question.md`).
*   **`summaries/`**: If session summaries are generated (e.g., by `agent-session-summarizer` or manually), they are stored here. (Uses `template_00_session_summary.md`).
*   **Other useful folders:** `blockers/`, `context/` (for external files or data brought into the session), `deferred/` (for ideas to tackle later), `docs/` (for draft documentation snippets related to the session's work), `environment/`, `features/` (for notes on specific features being designed), `feedback/`, `research/`, `snippets/`.

### Linking Artifacts:

*   Whenever a significant artifact is created in one of these subdirectories, its relative path (e.g., `artifacts/design_outputs/WebApp_Analytics_PoC/product_strategy_v1.md`) **MUST** be added to the `related_artifacts` array in the `session_log.md`'s TOML frontmatter. This creates a direct link from the session's main log to all its important contents.

## 5. How It All Connects: Traceability

The Session Management system provides end-to-end traceability:

1.  You start a **Session** with `roo-commander` for a specific goal (e.g., "Design Data Product PoC").
2.  The **`session_log.md`** records this goal and the creation of a top-level MDTM Task (e.g., `TASK-MDP-XYZ`) assigned to `manager-data-product`.
3.  The **MDTM Task file** (`.roo/commander/tasks/.../TASK-MDP-XYZ.md`) details how `manager-data-product` breaks down the goal and delegates sub-tasks to its squad (e.g., `TASK-DPSTRAT-ABC` for the strategist).
4.  Each **Squad Member's MDTM sub-task** details its specific work and lists its `output_artifacts` (e.g., `TASK-DPSTRAT-ABC` outputs `product_strategy.md`).
5.  The path to this `product_strategy.md` (e.g., `artifacts/design_outputs/MyPoC/product_strategy.md`) is recorded in `TASK-DPSTRAT-ABC`'s `output_artifacts`, then in `TASK-MDP-XYZ`'s `output_artifacts` (as a final deliverable of the manager), and also in the main `session_log.md`'s `related_artifacts`.

This interconnected system of logs and linked files ensures you can always trace how a final deliverable was created and what activities occurred during its development.
