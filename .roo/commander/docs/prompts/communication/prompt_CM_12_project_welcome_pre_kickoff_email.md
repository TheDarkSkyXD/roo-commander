Subject: **Draft Project Welcome & Pre-Kickoff Email for: [Project Name] to [Client Name]**

I need a draft for a project welcome and pre-kickoff email to **[Client Name/Key Client Contact(s)]** for the upcoming **[Project Name]** project. This email is sent after the contract is signed but before the official kickoff meeting.

**1. Project Welcome Context & Email Objectives:**
   *   **Client Name / Primary Contact(s):** `[e.g., Jane Doe at Innovate Corp]`
   *   **Project Name:** `[Full Name of the Project]`
   *   **Brief Reiteration of Project Goal (1 sentence):** `[Remind them of the main objective, e.g., "to redesign your e-commerce platform for an enhanced user experience and increased conversions."]`
   *   **Key Contact(s) from Our Agency for this Project:**
        *   Primary Contact (e.g., Project Manager): `[Name, Title, Email]`
        *   Secondary Contact (e.g., Account Manager, if different): `[Name, Title, Email]`
   *   **Scheduled Kickoff Meeting Details (if already set, otherwise state it will be scheduled shortly):**
        *   Date: `[YYYY-MM-DD or "To be scheduled this week"]`
        *   Time: `[HH:MM AM/PM Timezone or "Details to follow"]`
        *   Location/Platform: `[e.g., "Google Meet (link will be in the calendar invite)"]`
   *   **Overall Goal of this Email:** [e.g., Officially welcome the client to the project, express excitement, introduce key agency contacts, set a positive tone, outline immediate next steps before the kickoff meeting, and provide any light preparatory information.]
   *   **Desired Tone:** [e.g., Enthusiastic and welcoming, professional and organized, reassuring and confident.]

**2. Information to Share Pre-Kickoff:**
   *   **What to Expect in the Kickoff Meeting (Briefly):** `[e.g., "In our kickoff meeting, we'll be focusing on introductions, a deeper dive into your objectives, our proposed project roadmap, and communication protocols."]`
   *   **Light Pre-Reading or "Thinking Points" (Optional - keep it minimal):** [Are there 1-2 simple things they could think about or a very short document they could glance at to make the kickoff more productive? Avoid heavy tasks.]
       e.g., `"- If you have any initial thoughts on your top 3 'must-have' features, it would be great to jot them down."`
       e.g., `"- You might find this short article on [relevant topic] a useful primer: [link] (optional read)."`
   *   **Access to Shared Drive/Project Management Tool (if setting up now):** `[e.g., "We'll be sending you an invitation to our shared Google Drive folder for project documents shortly.", "You'll receive an invite to join our Asana project board where we'll track progress."]`
   *   **Any Immediate Housekeeping Items (e.g., scheduling kickoff if not set):** `[e.g., "Our project coordinator, [Name], will reach out by [Date] to schedule the kickoff meeting at a time that works best for your team."]`

**3. Request for Email Draft:**

Please draft a project welcome and pre-kickoff email based on the information above. The email should:
*   Have a warm, welcoming, and informative subject line (e.g., "Welcome to [Project Name]! Next Steps & Kickoff Details").
*   Enthusiastically welcome the client to the project.
*   Briefly reiterate the project's main goal.
*   Introduce the key agency contact(s) for the project.
