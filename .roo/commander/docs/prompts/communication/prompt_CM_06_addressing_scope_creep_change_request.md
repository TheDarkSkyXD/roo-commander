Subject: **Draft Email Addressing Scope Creep / Change Request for: [Project Name] - Regarding [Specific Request/Feature]**

I need a draft for an email to **[Client Name/Key Client Contact(s)]** to address a recent request or emerging situation that appears to be outside the originally agreed-upon scope for the **[Project Name]** project, specifically concerning **[Brief description of the out-of-scope request or feature, e.g., 'the new e-commerce functionality', 'integrating with third-party CRM X', 'adding three additional landing page designs']**.

**1. Situation Context & Email Objectives:**
   *   **Client Name / Primary Contact(s):** `[e.g., Jane Doe at Innovate Corp]`
   *   **Project Name:** `[Full Name of the Project]`
   *   **Specific Out-of-Scope Request/Feature:** `[Clearly describe the client's request or the new requirement that is considered out of scope. Be objective.]`
       e.g., `"During our meeting on [Date], you requested the addition of a full e-commerce module with payment gateway integration."`
   *   **Reference to Original Scope (if possible):** `[Briefly refer to the SOW, contract section, or prior agreement that defines the current scope. e.g., "As per our signed SOW dated [Date], the current scope focuses on [original scope summary] and does not include [the requested feature]."]`
   *   **Our Agency's Assessment of the Request:** [Is it a minor addition, a significant new feature, something that fundamentally changes the project?]
   *   **Potential Impact of Incorporating the Request (as is):**
        *   **Timeline Impact:** `[Estimate potential delay, e.g., "an additional 3-4 weeks"]`
        *   **Budget/Cost Impact:** `[Estimate potential additional cost, e.g., "approximately $X - $Y", or "will require a separate budget allocation"]`
        *   **Resource Impact:** `[e.g., "Would require pulling developers from other planned tasks", "May need specialized expertise not currently allocated"]`
   *   **Overall Goal of this Email:** [e.g., Acknowledge the request professionally, clearly explain why it's out of scope, outline potential impacts, propose a path forward (e.g., change order, discuss as Phase 2), maintain a positive client relationship.]
   *   **Desired Tone:** [e.g., Professional and firm but collaborative, solution-oriented, transparent, empathetic to their request but clear on boundaries.]

**2. Proposed Options / Path Forward:**
   [Outline 1-3 potential ways to handle this request. Be constructive.]
   ```text
   // Example Options:
   // 1. **Formal Change Order:** We can prepare a formal change order detailing the scope, timeline, and cost implications for this new feature for your review and approval.
   // 2. **Phase 2 / Future Enhancement:** We can add this to a list of desired enhancements to be considered for a subsequent phase of the project after the current scope is delivered.
   // 3. **Descoped Feature for Current Phase:** We could explore a significantly simplified/MVP version of this request that might fit within a minimal extension of the current timeline/budget, but this would require further discussion on trade-offs.
   // 4. **Discussion Meeting:** We'd be happy to schedule a brief call to discuss this request further, understand its priority, and explore these options in more detail.
   ```
   *   **Preferred Option (if any, or what you want to guide them towards):** `[e.g., "We recommend discussing this via a change order to ensure clarity."]`

**3. Request for Email Draft:**

Please draft an email addressing the scope creep / change request based on the information above. The email should:
*   Have a clear and professional subject line (e.g., "Following Up on Your Request for [Feature] - [Project Name]").
*   Acknowledge the client's request positively and show understanding of its potential value.
*   Clearly and politely explain why the request is considered outside the current agreed-upon scope, referencing the original agreement if possible.
*   Outline the potential impacts (timeline, budget, resources) if the request were to be incorporated into the current project as is.
*   Propose clear, constructive options or a path forward for addressing the request.
*   Maintain a collaborative and solution-oriented tone, aiming to preserve the client relationship.
*   Suggest a next step (e.g., a meeting to discuss).
*   Be well-organized and easy to understand.

Provide the **Subject Line** and the **Email Body**.
