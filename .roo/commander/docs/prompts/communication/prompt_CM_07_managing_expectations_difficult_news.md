Subject: **Draft Email to Client Regarding: [Brief, Neutral Statement of Issue] for [Project Name]**

I need a draft for an email to **[Client Name/Key Client Contact(s)]** to proactively manage expectations and/or deliver difficult news regarding **[Brief, Neutral Statement of the Issue, e.g., 'a potential timeline adjustment', 'an unforeseen technical challenge', 'a necessary budget revision']** for the **[Project Name]** project.

**1. Situation Context & Email Objectives:**
   *   **Client Name / Primary Contact(s):** `[e.g., Jane Doe at Innovate Corp]`
   *   **Project Name:** `[Full Name of the Project]`
   *   **The Difficult News / Expectation to Manage (Be Clear & Factual):** `[Clearly and objectively state the issue. Avoid jargon or overly defensive language. e.g., "We've encountered an unexpected complexity with the third-party API integration that will require an estimated additional 5 days of development.", "Due to unforeseen vendor delays in delivering component X, we are projecting a one-week shift in the go-live date for Phase 1.", "A critical team member has had an unexpected medical emergency, which will temporarily impact our velocity on Task Y."]`
   *   **Reason(s) for the Issue (Brief, Factual Explanation):** `[Provide a concise, honest, and professional explanation of why this situation has occurred. Focus on facts, not excuses.]`
       e.g., `"The API documentation provided by the vendor was incomplete, requiring significant additional discovery and testing."`
       e.g., `"Our primary supplier for component X has informed us of a production delay on their end."`
   *   **Impact on Project (Timeline, Budget, Scope, Quality - be specific):**
        *   **Timeline Impact:** `[e.g., "This is likely to shift the final delivery date for Phase 1 from [Original Date] to [New Projected Date]."]`
        *   **Budget/Cost Impact (if any):** `[e.g., "We are working to absorb the extra development time within the current budget, but if extensive rework is needed for the API, we may need to discuss a small budget adjustment for that specific component.", "No immediate budget impact is anticipated."]`
        *   **Scope Impact (if any):** `[e.g., "No impact to the agreed-upon scope.", "To maintain the current timeline, we might need to consider descoping feature Z."]`
        *   **Quality Impact (if any):** `[e.g., "We are committed to maintaining the quality standards and this will not be compromised."]`
   *   **Our Proposed Solution / Mitigation Plan / Next Steps:** `[What are you doing or proposing to do to address the issue and minimize negative impact? Be proactive and solution-oriented.]`
       e.g., `"Our team is already working on a revised integration plan and reallocating resources to expedite this. We will provide a detailed updated timeline by [Date]."`
       e.g., `"We are actively seeking alternative suppliers for component X and will update you on progress by [Date]. In parallel, we are reprioritizing other tasks to minimize overall project delay."`
   *   **Overall Goal of this Email:** [e.g., Inform the client transparently, manage their expectations, demonstrate proactive problem-solving, maintain trust, propose a clear path forward, request a discussion if needed.]
   *   **Desired Tone:** [e.g., Empathetic and transparent, professional and accountable, calm and solution-focused, reassuring (if appropriate).]

**2. Request for Client Input/Discussion (Optional):**
   *   **Specific Question(s) for the Client (if any):** `[e.g., "Would you be available for a brief call on [Date] to discuss this and our proposed mitigation plan in more detail?"]`
   *   **Options for Client to Consider (if applicable):** `[e.g., "We could proceed with option A (delay feature Y) or option B (approve a small budget increase for expedited resources). We'd like to discuss your preference."]`

**3. Request for Email Draft:**

Please draft an email to the client based on the information above. The email should:
*   Have a clear, professional, and neutral subject line that prepares the client for important information without causing undue alarm (e.g., "Important Update Regarding [Project Name]: [Brief Issue Summary]").
*   Begin with a professional and empathetic opening.
*   Clearly, concisely, and factually state the difficult news or the expectation being managed.
*   Provide a brief, professional explanation for the situation.
*   Clearly outline the impact(s) on the project (timeline, budget, scope, quality).
*   Proactively present your proposed solution, mitigation plan, or next steps from your side.
*   If necessary, clearly state what input or decision is needed from the client, or suggest a follow-up discussion.
*   Reiterate commitment to the project's success and the client relationship.
*   Maintain a tone that is accountable, transparent, and solution-oriented.
*   End with a professional closing.
