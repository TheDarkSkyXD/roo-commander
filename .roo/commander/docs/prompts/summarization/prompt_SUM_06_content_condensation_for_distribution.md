I require a condensed version of the following content piece: **[Title or Brief Description of Original Content, e.g., 'Our Latest Blog Post on AI Trends', 'The Q3 Industry Research Report', 'Case Study: Client X Success Story']** to be adapted for **[Target Channel/Format, e.g., 'a series of 3 Tweets', 'a LinkedIn post', 'an internal Slack announcement', 'a short blurb for our email newsletter']**.

        *   "A 50-word blurb for an email newsletter, ending with a link to the full content."
        *   "A short, engaging paragraph for a Slack announcement (under 100 words)."]

   *   **Tone for Condensed Version:** [e.g., Engaging, informative, urgent, witty, professional. Should it match the original or be adapted for the channel?]
   *   **Relevant Hashtags (for social media):** [Suggest 2-3 relevant hashtags if applicable.]

**2. Original Content for Condensation:**
