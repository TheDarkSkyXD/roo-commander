Subject: **Request for Draft Sales Script/Talking Points Framework: [Type of Sales Interaction] for [Product/Service]**

I require a first draft of a sales script framework or key talking points for a **[Type of Sales Interaction, e.g., 'Discovery Call', 'Product Demo Script', 'Objection Handling Guide', 'Cold Outreach Voicemail Script']** related to our **[Product/Service Name]**.

**1. Sales Interaction Overview & Context:**

*   **Type of Sales Interaction:** `[e.g., Initial Discovery Call, Scheduled Product Demo, Follow-up Call, Cold Call, Voicemail, Email Outreach Snippet.]`
*   **Product/Service Being Sold:** `[Clearly name and briefly describe the product/service.]`
*   **Target Prospect Profile/Persona:** `[Describe the ideal customer: e.g., 'Marketing Managers in mid-sized tech companies', 'Small business owners struggling with [pain point]', 'VPs of Operations in manufacturing'. Include their likely needs, pain points, and goals.]`
*   **Primary Goal of this Specific Interaction:** `[What is the immediate objective? e.g., 'Qualify the lead and book a demo', 'Demonstrate key value of Feature X', 'Address common concern Y and move to proposal stage', 'Get a call back', 'Secure a meeting'.]`
*   **Stage in Sales Funnel:** `[e.g., Awareness/Prospecting, Qualification, Consideration/Evaluation, Decision/Closing.]`
*   **Key Differentiators/Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) of our Product/Service:** `[List 1-3 USPs relevant to this prospect and interaction type.]`
*   **Desired Tone & Style for the Interaction:** `[e.g., Consultative and helpful, confident and authoritative, friendly and rapport-building, urgent and benefit-driven (for some cold outreach).]`

**2. Script Framework & Key Content Elements (AI to develop based on interaction type):**

*   **Opening / Introduction:**
    *   `[AI to suggest an opening that builds rapport, states the purpose (if appropriate), and grabs attention. For cold outreach, focus on a compelling hook.]`
*   **Needs Discovery / Qualification Questions (Especially for Discovery Calls):**
    *   `[Ask AI to generate 5-7 key open-ended questions to understand the prospect's situation, challenges, needs, goals, decision-making process, budget (if appropriate at this stage), and timeline. e.g., 'What are the biggest challenges you're currently facing with X?', 'What would an ideal solution look like for you?']`
*   **Value Proposition / Solution Presentation (Tailored to Interaction Type):**
    *   `[AI to outline how to briefly present the product/service, focusing on the benefits that address the prospect's likely needs (derived from persona or discovery questions). For a demo, this would be about structuring the demo flow around key value points.]`
*   **Key Talking Points / Feature-Benefit Links:**
    *   For USP 1: `[AI to draft a talking point linking this USP to a prospect benefit.]`
    *   For USP 2: `[AI to draft a talking point linking this USP to a prospect benefit.]`
    *   (If specific features need to be mentioned, list them, and AI can link to benefits)
*   **Common Objections & Potential Responses (Especially for Objection Handling Guide or later stage calls):**
    *   Objection 1: `[e.g., 'It's too expensive.']`
        *   Response Framework: `[AI to suggest a framework/talking points to address this, e.g., focus on ROI, value, payment options.]`
    *   Objection 2: `[e.g., 'We're already using a competitor.']`
        *   Response Framework: `[AI to suggest how to differentiate and highlight advantages.]`
    *   (List 1-2 more common objections if known, or ask AI to suggest common ones for this type of product/service.)
*   **Call to Action / Next Steps:**
    *   `[AI to suggest clear, specific next steps and how to ask for them. e.g., 'Would you be open to a 30-minute demo next Tuesday?', 'What would be the best way to move forward with a proposal?', 'When can we schedule a follow-up to discuss X?']`
*   **Closing:**
    *   `[AI to suggest a professional and positive closing.]`

**3. Additional Instructions (Optional):**

*   **Things to Emphasize:** `[Any specific benefits, success stories (conceptual), or differentiators to weave in.]`
*   **Things to Avoid:** `[e.g., 'Sounding too scripted or robotic', 'Overwhelming with technical details too early', 'High-pressure tactics (unless specified for a very particular context)'.]`
*   **Length/Duration of Interaction (Conceptual):** `[e.g., 'Discovery call: 20-30 minutes', 'Voicemail: under 30 seconds'. This helps AI gauge detail level.]`
*   **Key Questions the Prospect Might Ask (and how to generally approach answering):** `[If you anticipate specific tough questions.]`

Please generate a structured framework or key talking points for this sales interaction. Focus on a logical flow, persuasive language (where appropriate), and clear guidance for the sales representative. I understand this will require human refinement, role-playing, and adaptation.
