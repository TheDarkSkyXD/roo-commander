Subject: **Request for Draft Short-Form Video Concept & Script Snippets: [Video Topic/Theme] for [Platform]**

I require a concept and initial script snippets/text overlay ideas for a short-form video about **[Video Topic/Theme, e.g., 'Quick Tip for Using Product X', 'Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse of Event Y', 'Participating in [Trending Challenge Z]']** for **[Platform, e.g., 'TikTok', 'Instagram Reels', 'YouTube Shorts']**.

**1. Video Overview & Specifications:**

*   **Video Topic/Theme:** `[Clearly define the core subject or theme of the video.]`
*   **Target Platform(s):** `[Specify TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, or if adaptable for multiple.]`
*   **Primary Goal of this Video:** `[What should this video achieve? e.g., 'Increase brand visibility', 'Drive engagement (likes, comments, shares)', 'Educate on a quick tip', 'Showcase company culture', 'Promote a specific product feature briefly', 'Entertain'.]`
*   **Target Audience on this Platform:** `[Describe the intended viewers: e.g., 'Gen Z interested in [trend]', 'Existing followers who like [type of content]', 'Potential customers looking for quick solutions'.]`
*   **Desired Video Length (Approximate):** `[e.g., 15 seconds, 30 seconds, up to 60 seconds. Be specific to platform norms.]`
*   **Desired Tone & Style:** `[e.g., Humorous and fast-paced, informative and quick, authentic and relatable, trendy and energetic, aesthetically pleasing and calm.]`
*   **Key Message (Must be very concise):** `[What is the single most important takeaway or feeling for the viewer in this short timeframe?]`
*   **Call to Action (CTA) (Subtle or direct, platform-appropriate):**
    *   `[e.g., 'Link in bio!', 'Comment below!', 'Follow for more!', 'Save this!', 'Shop now (if product focused and platform allows direct linking easily)'.]`
*   **Specific Trend, Sound, or Challenge to Incorporate (Optional):** `[If you want the video to leverage a current trend, specify it here. e.g., 'Use the [trending audio name] sound', 'Participate in the [challenge name] challenge'.]`

**2. Video Concept & Content Elements:**

*   **Overall Video Concept/Angle:**
    *   `[Ask the AI to propose 1-2 distinct concepts or angles for the video based on the topic and goals. Or, provide your own concept idea for the AI to flesh out.]`
    *   Example user input: `Concept: A quick "day in the life" snippet showing how our product solves a common problem.`

*   **Key Visual Sequence / Scenes (Conceptual - AI to suggest based on concept):**
    *   Scene 1 (Hook - First 1-3 seconds): `[AI to suggest a strong visual and/or textual hook to stop scrolling.]`
    *   Scene 2: `[AI to suggest visual and action.]`
    *   Scene 3: `[AI to suggest visual and action.]`
    *   (Number of scenes will depend on length and concept)
    *   Scene X (CTA/End Screen): `[AI to suggest how to visually present the CTA or end message.]`

*   **Script Snippets / Text Overlays / Voiceover Points (AI to draft):**
    *   `[Based on the concept and scenes, the AI should draft concise text for on-screen overlays, or key bullet points for a quick voiceover, or dialogue if it's a skit. This should be very brief and punchy.]`
    *   Example for a "Quick Tip" video:
        *   Overlay 1: "Tired of [Problem]?" (Visual: Showing the problem)
        *   Overlay 2: "Try this hack!" (Visual: Starting the solution)
        *   Overlay 3: "[Step 1 of hack]" (Visual: Demo step 1)
        *   Overlay 4: "[Step 2 of hack]" (Visual: Demo step 2)
        *   Overlay 5: "Boom! âœ¨ #LifeHack #[Topic]" (Visual: Showing result + CTA)

*   **Music/Sound Suggestion (Conceptual):**
    *   `[e.g., 'Upbeat trending pop song', 'Calm lofi beat', 'Use the specified trending audio', 'No music, just voiceover and natural sound'.]`

**3. Additional Instructions (Optional):**

*   **Things to Emphasize:** `[Any specific product feature, benefit, or feeling to strongly convey.]`
*   **Things to Avoid:** `[e.g., 'Being too salesy', 'Complex explanations', 'Slow pacing'.]`
*   **Emoji Usage:** `[e.g., 'Use 1-2 relevant emojis in text overlays', 'Match platform norms'.]`
*   **Branding Elements (Subtle):** `[e.g., 'Briefly show logo at end', 'Use brand colors in text/graphics'.]`
