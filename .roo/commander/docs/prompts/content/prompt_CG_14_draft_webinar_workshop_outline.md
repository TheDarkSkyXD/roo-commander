        *   Learning Objective(s) for this module: `[Link to overall learning objectives covered here]`

Please generate a detailed outline for this webinar/workshop, including distinct modules with titles, key talking points/content ideas for each module, and suggestions for interactive activities (especially if a workshop). The outline should logically progress towards achieving the stated learning objectives and conclude with the call to action. I understand this will require human development of full content, slides, and facilitation notes.
