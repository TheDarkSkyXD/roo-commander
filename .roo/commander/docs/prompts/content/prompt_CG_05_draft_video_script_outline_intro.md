Subject: **Request for Draft Video Script Outline & Introduction: [Video Title/Topic]**

I require a first draft of a video script outline and the introductory section (e.g., first 15-30 seconds of narration) for a video titled/about **[Video Title/Topic, e.g., 'Explainer for Product X Feature Y', 'Tutorial on How to Use Software Z', 'Promotional Video for Upcoming Event A']**.

**1. Video Overview & Specifications:**

*   **Video Title/Topic:** `[Clearly define the core subject matter of the video.]`
*   **Primary Goal of the Video:** `[What should this video achieve? e.g., 'Explain how [feature] works', 'Teach viewers to perform [task]', 'Generate excitement for [event]', 'Drive viewers to [website/landing page]', 'Build brand awareness'.]`
*   **Target Audience:** `[Describe the intended viewers: e.g., 'New users unfamiliar with the product', 'Technical audience needing detailed instructions', 'Potential customers considering a purchase', 'General public interested in [topic]'.]`
*   **Desired Video Length (Approximate):** `[e.g., 30 seconds, 1-2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10-15 minutes. This will influence the depth of the outline.]`
*   **Video Format/Style:** `[e.g., Screencast tutorial, animated explainer, talking head with B-roll, live-action demonstration, testimonial video.]`
*   **Desired Tone & Pacing:** `[e.g., Fast-paced and energetic, calm and informative, friendly and conversational, professional and authoritative, humorous and lighthearted.]`
*   **Key Message(s) or Takeaways for the Viewer:** `[What are the 1-3 most important things the viewer should understand or remember after watching?]`
*   **Call to Action (CTA) for the Video (to be placed at the end, usually):**
    *   CTA Message: `[e.g., 'Visit our website to learn more!', 'Subscribe for more tutorials!', 'Download the free guide mentioned in the video!', 'Sign up for your free trial today!']`
    *   CTA Visual Cue (Conceptual): `[e.g., 'Show URL on screen', 'Point to subscribe button', 'Display QR code'.]`

**2. Content Outline & Introduction Details:**

*   **Introduction (Draft First 15-30 Seconds of Narration):**
    *   **Hook:** `[Suggest how to immediately grab the viewer's attention in the first 3-5 seconds, or ask the AI to devise a compelling visual and verbal hook.]`
    *   **Briefly State the Video's Purpose/Value:** `[Clearly tell the viewer what the video is about and what they will gain by watching it.]`
    *   **(Optional) Teaser for Content:** `[Hint at what will be covered.]`

*   **Main Body Sections (Outline key sections/segments for the rest of the video. The AI should propose headings/topics for these sections based on the video's goal and topic):**
    *   `[Ask the AI to develop a logical flow of 3-5 main sections (or more, depending on video length) that will cover the topic comprehensively and lead to the CTA. You can provide high-level themes for these sections if you have them.]`
    *   Example of user input if providing themes:
        *   `Section 1 Theme: The Problem We Solve`
        *   `Section 2 Theme: Introducing Our Solution (Product X)`
        *   `Section 3 Theme: Key Feature Y Explained (with demo idea)`
        *   `Section 4 Theme: Benefits & Use Cases`

*   **Conclusion:**
    *   `[The AI should outline a brief summary of key points.]`
    *   `[The AI should incorporate the Call to Action specified in Section 1.]`

*   **Visual Ideas (Conceptual, for AI to consider while drafting narration):**
    *   `[For the introduction, suggest initial visuals: e.g., 'Dynamic title card', 'Quick cuts of the problem in action', 'Presenter looking directly at camera'.]`
    *   `[For main body sections, the AI can suggest conceptual visual accompaniments for the narration it drafts for the outline, e.g., 'Show screen recording of this step', 'Use an animation to illustrate this concept', 'B-roll footage of happy customers'.]`

**3. Additional Instructions (Optional):**

*   **Things to Emphasize:** `[Any specific points, benefits, or perspectives you want strongly highlighted in the narration or outline.]`
*   **Things to Avoid:** `[Any topics, claims, tones, or common misconceptions to steer clear of.]`
*   **Language Complexity:** `[e.g., 'Keep language simple and accessible', 'Technical terms are okay if explained'.]`
*   **Pacing for Narration (Conceptual):** `[e.g., 'Aim for a conversational pace, approximately 130-150 words per minute for narration'.]`

Please generate a well-structured outline for the main body and conclusion, and a draft of the narration for the introduction (approx. 15-30 seconds). The outline should suggest key talking points for each section. While this is a draft, aim for clarity, logical flow, and engaging language. I understand this will require human editing, visual development, and further refinement.
