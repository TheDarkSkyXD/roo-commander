Subject: **Brainstorming Request: [Number] New Feature Ideas for [Product/Service Name]**

I require your creative assistance to brainstorm **[Number, e.g., 5-7]** new feature ideas or significant enhancements for our **[Product/Service Name, e.g., 'TaskMaster Pro productivity app', 'GreenThumb gardening subscription box', 'ConnectSphere social networking platform']**.

**1. Product/Service Context:**
   *   **Product/Service Name & Core Functionality:** [Clearly describe the existing product or service. What does it currently do? What is its primary purpose?]
   *   **Primary Goal for New Features/Enhancements:** [What are you trying to achieve with new features? (e.g., Increase user engagement, attract a new user segment, solve a specific existing user problem, improve retention, create a competitive advantage, generate a new revenue stream).]
   *   **Target User Persona(s):** [Describe the primary users of this product/service. What are their goals, needs, pain points, and current behaviors related to this product or similar products?]
   *   **Existing Key Features (Briefly):** [List 2-3 of the most important existing features to provide context.]
   *   **Known User Pain Points or Unmet Needs (if any):** [Are there any specific problems users currently experience with the product, or needs that are not being met by current features or competitors?]
   *   **Competitor Landscape (Optional - what are they offering?):** [Briefly mention 1-2 key competitors and any standout features they have, or gaps in their offerings.]
   *   **Technological Constraints or Opportunities (if any):** [Are there any specific technologies that must be used, or new technologies that could be leveraged (e.g., AI, AR, specific APIs)?]
   *   **Strategic Direction/Vision for the Product (if defined):** [Where do you see this product heading in the next 1-3 years?]

**2. Request for Feature Ideas:**

For each of the **[Same Number as above]** distinct new feature ideas or enhancements, please provide the following:

*   **A. Feature Name/Title:** [A short, descriptive, and potentially catchy name for the feature.]
*   **B. Feature Description:** [A clear explanation of what the feature does and how it works from a user's perspective.]
*   **C. User Problem/Need Addressed:** [Which specific user pain point or unmet need (from Section 1 or newly identified) does this feature solve or address?]
*   **D. Key Benefits to the User:** [What are the primary advantages or value propositions this feature offers to the user? How does it make their life better or easier?]
*   **E. Potential Impact on Primary Goal (from Section 1):** [How might this feature contribute to achieving the primary goal for new features (e.g., increase engagement, attract new users)?]
*   **F. Uniqueness/Innovation Factor (Optional):** [Is this feature particularly novel or innovative compared to existing solutions or competitor offerings?]
*   **G. Potential Challenges or Considerations for Implementation (High-Level):** [Briefly note any obvious challenges like technical complexity, data privacy concerns, significant resource needs, etc. This is not a technical spec, just initial thoughts.]

**Guidelines for Generation:**
*   Aim for a mix of ideas: some incremental improvements, some more innovative or "blue sky."
*   Focus on features that provide clear user value and align with the product's core purpose and strategic direction.
*   Consider feasibility at a high level, but don't let it overly constrain initial brainstorming.

I am looking for creative yet strategically relevant feature ideas that can enhance our product/service offering.
