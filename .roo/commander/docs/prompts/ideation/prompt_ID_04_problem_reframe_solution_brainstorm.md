Subject: **Brainstorming Request: Reframing & Solutions for Problem: [Brief Description of Problem]**

I require your creative and analytical assistance to reframe the following problem and brainstorm innovative solutions: **[Briefly state the core problem, e.g., 'low user engagement on our mobile app', 'high customer churn rate in Q2', 'inefficient internal reporting process', 'difficulty attracting top engineering talent']**.

**1. Problem Context & Current Understanding:**
   *   **Detailed Problem Statement:** [Provide a more detailed description of the problem. What are its symptoms? Who is affected? What is the impact? When and where does it occur?]
   *   **Current Assumed Causes (if any):** [What are the current hypotheses or beliefs about why this problem is happening? List any known contributing factors.]
   *   **Previous Attempts to Solve (if any, and their outcomes):** [Have there been prior efforts to address this problem? What was tried, and what were the results?]
   *   **Desired Outcome / Ideal Future State:** [If this problem were solved, what would the ideal situation look like? What specific positive changes would be observed?]
   *   **Key Stakeholders Involved/Affected:** [Who are the main people or groups impacted by this problem or involved in potential solutions?]
   *   **Constraints or Limitations (if any):** [Are there any budget, time, technology, or policy constraints that solutions would need to consider?]

**2. Request for Problem Reframing & Solution Brainstorming:**

**Part 1: Problem Reframing**
Please generate **[Number, e.g., 3-4]** distinct ways to **reframe or reinterpret the problem statement** provided above. For each reframing, consider:
    *   Looking at it from a different stakeholder's perspective.
    *   Challenging underlying assumptions.
    *   Broadening or narrowing the scope of the problem.
    *   Focusing on opportunities hidden within the problem.
    *   Asking "What if the opposite were true?" or other provocative questions.

    For each reframing, provide:
    *   **A. Reframed Problem Statement:** [The new way of stating or looking at the problem.]
    *   **B. Rationale for this Reframing:** [Briefly explain the shift in perspective or the assumption being challenged.]

**Part 2: Innovative Solution Brainstorming (for each reframing)**
For **each** of the reframed problem statements generated in Part 1, please brainstorm **[Number, e.g., 2-3]** innovative or unconventional solution ideas.

    For each solution idea, provide:
    *   **C. Solution Idea/Concept:** [A clear, concise description of the solution.]
    *   **D. How it Addresses the Reframed Problem:** [Explain its connection to that specific reframing.]
    *   **E. Key Potential Benefits:** [What are the main advantages of this solution?]
    *   **F. Novelty/Innovation Aspect:** [What makes this solution different or creative compared to standard approaches?]
    *   **G. Potential First Steps or Experiments to Test the Idea (High-Level):** [What's a small, initial action that could be taken to explore this solution's viability?]

**Example Structure for Output (for one reframing and its solutions):**

**Reframing 1:**
   *   **A. Reframed Problem Statement:** [New Statement]
   *   **B. Rationale:** [Explanation]
   *   **Solutions for Reframing 1:**
        1.  **C. Solution Idea:** [Idea]
            *   **D. How it Addresses:** [Explanation]
            *   **E. Benefits:** [Details]
            *   **F. Novelty:** [Details]
            *   **G. First Steps:** [Details]
        2.  **C. Solution Idea:** [Idea]
            *   ... (and so on for D, E, F, G)

**(Repeat for each subsequent Reframing and its associated Solutions)**

**Guidelines for Generation:**
*   Reframings should offer genuinely different perspectives on the problem.
*   Solution ideas should aim for creativity and innovation, moving beyond obvious fixes.
*   Consider solutions that might involve changes to process, technology, people/skills, or mindset.

I am looking to break free from conventional thinking about this problem and explore a wider range of potential solutions.
