   *   **Key Information or Skills to be Conveyed (if applicable):** [What core knowledge or abilities should attendees gain?]
   *   **Budget Considerations for Activities (Optional - High, Medium, Low):** [e.g., "Low budget, so activities should require minimal materials." or "Medium budget, can accommodate some props or simple tech tools."]

**2. Request for Themes, Titles & Activities:**

        2.  **Brief Rationale:** [Why this theme is relevant and appealing for the topic and audience.]

*   **B. Catchy Event/Workshop Titles ([Number, e.g., 5-7] options):**

        4.  **Estimated Duration (Roughly):** [e.g., 15 min, 30-45 min, 1 hour.]
        5.  **Required Materials/Tech (Minimal):** [e.g., Flip charts, sticky notes, breakout rooms in Zoom, polling software.]
        6.  **Why it would be engaging for *this* audience:** [Connect to audience characteristics.]

**Guidelines for Generation:**
