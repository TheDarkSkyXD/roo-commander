Subject: **Brainstorming Request: [Number] Campaign Concepts for [Product/Service/Brand]**

I require your creative assistance to brainstorm **[Number, e.g., 3-5]** distinct campaign concepts for **[Product/Service/Brand Name, e.g., 'our new line of eco-friendly coffee pods', 'the "SafeNet" cybersecurity software', 'rebranding of "Vintage Threads" clothing store']**.

**1. Campaign Context & Objectives:**
   *   **Product/Service/Brand to be Promoted:** [Clearly describe what is being promoted. What are its key features or unique selling propositions (USPs)?]
   *   **Primary Campaign Objective(s):** [What is the main goal of this campaign? (e.g., Drive initial sales, increase brand awareness by X%, generate Y qualified leads, educate the market about a new category, shift brand perception from X to Y).] Be specific.
   *   **Target Audience:** [Describe the specific audience segment(s) this campaign should reach. Include demographics, psychographics, pain points, needs, motivations, and media consumption habits if known.]
   *   **Campaign Duration (Approximate, if known):** [e.g., 6 weeks, Q3, ongoing.]
   *   **Budget Tier (Optional - High, Medium, Low):** [This can help tailor the scale of ideas, e.g., "Medium budget, allowing for some paid media and content creation but not a national TV ad."]
   *   **Brand Voice/Personality to Reflect:** [e.g., Playful and witty, authoritative and trustworthy, empathetic and supportive, innovative and cutting-edge.]
   *   **Mandatory Inclusions or Exclusions (if any):** [Are there any specific messages, taglines, brand elements, or channels that MUST be included or avoided?]
   *   **Desired Tone/Feeling of the Campaign:** [e.g., Inspiring, urgent, humorous, reassuring, sophisticated.]

**2. Request for Campaign Concepts:**

For each of the **[Same Number as above]** distinct campaign concepts, please provide the following:

*   **A. Concept Name/Title:** [A short, catchy name or title for the campaign concept.]
*   **B. Core Message/Big Idea:** [The central theme or overarching message of this campaign concept. What is the one key takeaway?]
*   **C. Unique Hook/Angle:** [What makes this concept different, memorable, or attention-grabbing? What is its unique selling proposition from a creative standpoint?]
*   **D. Potential Primary Channel(s):** [Suggest 1-3 primary marketing channels where this concept could be most effectively executed (e.g., Instagram & TikTok, LinkedIn & Email Marketing, YouTube & Search Ads, PR & Influencer Outreach).]
*   **E. Key Visual Idea(s) (Briefly):** [A brief description of the kind of visuals that might accompany this concept (e.g., "User-generated content style photos," "Animated explainer videos," "Dramatic, cinematic shots," "Clean, minimalist graphics").]
*   **F. Example Tagline/Slogan for this Concept:** [A sample tagline that encapsulates the core message of this specific concept.]
*   **G. Why it Might Resonate with the Target Audience:** [Briefly explain the connection between this concept and the target audience's motivations or interests.]

**Guidelines for Generation:**
*   Aim for **distinctly different** concepts, not just minor variations.
*   Consider a mix of approaches if possible (e.g., emotional, rational, humorous, problem/solution).
*   Focus on high-level concepts rather than detailed execution plans at this stage.

I am looking for creative and strategically sound starting points that we can then develop further.
