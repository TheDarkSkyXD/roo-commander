Subject: **Brainstorming Request: [Number] Name Ideas for [Type of Entity: New Product/Service/Company/Feature]**

I require your creative assistance to brainstorm **[Number, e.g., 10-15]** potential names for a **[Type of Entity, e.g., 'new sustainable coffee brand', 'software-as-a-service for project management', 'a new feature within our existing app that does X', 'a parent company for our diverse ventures']**.

**1. Naming Context & Objectives:**
   *   **Entity to be Named:** [Clearly describe what needs a name. If it's a product/service/feature, what does it do? If it's a company, what is its mission or industry?]
   *   **Target Audience:** [Describe the specific audience this name should appeal to. Consider their demographics, psychographics, values, and language style.]
   *   **Core Brand Attributes/Personality/Values to Convey:** [What key characteristics, feelings, or values should the name evoke or align with? (e.g., Innovative, trustworthy, playful, sophisticated, eco-friendly, simple, powerful, community-focused).]
   *   **Key Differentiators or Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) of the Entity:** [What makes this entity distinct from competitors or alternatives?]
   *   **Desired Connotations (Feelings/Ideas to Associate with the Name):** [e.g., Speed, reliability, luxury, ease of use, growth, connection.]
   *   **Connotations to Avoid:** [Are there any specific ideas, feelings, or associations the name should definitely NOT evoke?]
   *   **Competitor Names (Optional - for differentiation awareness):** [List 1-3 names of key competitors or similar entities to help ensure uniqueness.]
   *   **Inspiration/Keywords/Themes (Optional):** [Are there any words, concepts, root words, metaphors, or themes that you like or that could serve as inspiration? (e.g., "nature," "synergy," "light," "flow," "ancient Greek words for wisdom").]
   *   **Practical Considerations (Optional):**
        *   **Desired Length:** [e.g., Short (1-2 syllables), medium, no preference.]
        *   **Type of Name:** [e.g., Descriptive, evocative, abstract, invented, compound words, acronyms. If open, state "No preference".]
        *   **Domain Name Availability:** [While the AI can't check live availability, it can aim for names that *sound* like they might have .com or other TLD availability (e.g., unique spellings, less common words).]
        *   **Pronunciation/Memorability:** [Should be easy to pronounce and remember for the target audience.]

**2. Request for Name Ideas:**

Please generate **[Same Number as above, e.g., 10-15]** distinct name ideas. For each name idea, please provide:

*   **A. Proposed Name:** [The name itself.]
*   **B. Brief Rationale/Explanation:** [Why this name? What does it suggest or imply? How does it connect to the brand attributes, target audience, or offering? (1-2 sentences)]
*   **C. Potential Connotations (Positive):** [What positive feelings or ideas might this name evoke?]
*   **D. Name Style/Type (Optional - if you can categorize it):** [e.g., Evocative, Descriptive, Invented, Modern, Classic.]

**Example Structure for Output:**

1.  **A. Proposed Name:** Solara
    *   **B. Rationale:** Suggests light, energy, and a bright future, fitting for an innovative solar tech company.
    *   **C. Potential Connotations:** Innovation, brightness, warmth, clarity, forward-thinking.
    *   **D. Name Style:** Evocative/Modern.

2.  **A. Proposed Name:** NexusPoint
    *   **B. Rationale:** Implies a central hub or connection point, suitable for a collaboration software.
    *   **C. Potential Connotations:** Connection, integration, centrality, efficiency.
    *   **D. Name Style:** Compound/Descriptive.

**(Repeat for each subsequent name idea)**

**Guidelines for Generation:**
*   Aim for a diverse range of name types and styles if no specific type is requested.
*   Consider names that are easy to spell, pronounce, and remember.
*   Avoid names that are too similar to existing well-known brands or competitors (if provided).
*   Think about how the name might look visually (e.g., in a logo).

I am looking for a broad set of creative and strategically sound name options to consider.
