Subject: **Request for High-Level Project Plan Outline: [Name of Project]**

I require assistance in generating a high-level project plan outline for the following project: **[Name of Project, e.g., 'New Company Website Launch', 'Q4 Marketing Campaign Execution', 'Development of Mobile App v2.0', 'Office Relocation Project']**.

**1. Project Context & Objectives:**
   *   **Project Name:** [Reiterate the official name of the project.]
   *   **Primary Goal(s) of the Project:** [What is the main overarching objective this project aims to achieve? What is the desired end state or key outcome?]
   *   **Specific Measurable Objectives (if defined):** [List 2-4 specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives for the project, if known. e.g., "Launch new website by October 31st," "Increase Q4 leads by 15% through the campaign," "Reduce app crashes by 50% in v2.0."]
   *   **Key Stakeholders (Groups or Individuals):** [Who are the primary individuals or groups invested in or impacted by this project? (e.g., Marketing Department, Sales Team, CEO, Client X, End Users).]
   *   **Known Constraints or Limitations:** [Are there any known budget limits, resource shortages, tight deadlines, technological limitations, or regulatory requirements? e.g., "Budget not to exceed $50,000," "Must integrate with existing CRM," "Launch must occur before industry conference."]
   *   **Projected Start Date / End Date (or Duration, if known):** [e.g., "Start June 1st, End Dec 31st," or "6-month project."]

**2. Key Information or Assumptions:**
   *   **Core Deliverables Expected (High-Level):** [What are the main tangible or intangible outputs of this project? e.g., "A fully functional e-commerce website," "A comprehensive campaign report," "A released mobile application on app stores."]
   *   **Main Success Criteria:** [Beyond the objectives, how will the overall success of this project be judged? e.g., "Positive user feedback," "Adoption rate of new feature," "Seamless office move with minimal disruption."]
   *   **Any Initial Ideas on Major Phases or Workstreams (if you have them):** [If you already have some thoughts on how the project might be broken down, list them here. Otherwise, the AI can suggest these.]
   *   **Critical Dependencies (Internal/External, if known):** [Are there any critical dependencies on other projects, teams, or external factors that could impact this project?]

**3. Request for Project Plan Outline:**

I need you to act as an experienced project manager and strategic planner. Based on the information provided above, please generate a comprehensive high-level project plan outline. The outline should be structured logically and include, but not be limited to, the following sections:

*   **A. Project Overview:**
    *   Brief restatement of Project Name, Goals, and Key Objectives.
*   **B. Scope Definition (High-Level):**
    *   Key Inclusions (what the project WILL deliver).
    *   Key Exclusions (what the project will NOT deliver, to manage expectations).
*   **C. Major Phases & Key Activities/Deliverables per Phase:**
    *   Suggest a logical sequence of project phases (e.g., Initiation, Planning, Design, Development/Execution, Testing/QA, Deployment/Launch, Closure/Review).
    *   For each phase, list 3-5 key activities or major deliverables.
*   **D. Estimated Timeline & Key Milestones:**
    *   Propose key milestones aligned with the end of major phases or significant deliverables.
    *   If a total duration was provided, give a rough allocation of time to each phase.
*   **E. Key Stakeholder Groups & Roles (Briefly):**
    *   Reiterate key stakeholders and suggest their primary role or interest in the project (e.g., Sponsor, Steering Committee, Project Team, End Users).
*   **F. Resource Categories Needed:**
    *   List general categories of resources required (e.g., Personnel (specify roles like Developer, Designer, Marketer), Budget, Technology/Tools, External Vendors, Facilities).
*   **G. Potential Risks & Mitigation Ideas (High-Level):**
    *   Identify 3-5 potential high-level risks that could impact the project (e.g., Scope creep, resource unavailability, technical challenges, external delays).
    *   For each risk, suggest a brief, high-level mitigation idea.
*   **H. Communication Plan Snippets (Key Elements to Consider):**
    *   Suggest key elements a communication plan should cover (e.g., Reporting frequency, key audiences for updates, methods of communication).
*   **I. Success Metrics & Evaluation:**
    *   Reiterate or suggest key metrics for measuring project success, aligned with the objectives.
    *   Suggest how/when the project's success will be evaluated.

Please present this outline in a clear, organized, and actionable format. The goal is to have a solid framework that can be used as a starting point for more detailed project planning.
