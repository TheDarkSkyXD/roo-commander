Subject: **Request for Detailed Content Outline: [Proposed Title or Topic of Content]**

I require assistance in generating a detailed content outline for a piece of long-form content: **[Proposed Title or Topic of Content, e.g., 'The Ultimate Guide to Sustainable Investing', 'Whitepaper: The Impact of AI on Customer Service', 'Research Report: Consumer Trends in E-commerce 2025', 'In-depth Article on the History of Jazz Music']**.

**1. Content Overview & Objectives:**
   *   **Proposed Title (or Working Title):** [Enter the current title idea.]
   *   **Primary Topic/Subject Matter:** [Clearly define the core subject of the content.]
   *   **Type of Content:** [e.g., Blog post (long-form), whitepaper, research report, comprehensive guide, e-book chapter, detailed article.]
   *   **Primary Goal(s) of this Content Piece:** [What is this content intended to achieve? (e.g., Educate the audience thoroughly, establish thought leadership, provide a definitive resource, support a specific marketing campaign, generate leads by offering valuable information).]
   *   **Target Audience:** [Describe the intended readers. What is their existing knowledge level of the topic? What are their interests, pain points, or questions this content should address?]
   *   **Key Message(s) or Core Argument(s):** [What are the 2-4 most important takeaways or central arguments the content should convey?]
   *   **Desired Tone & Style:** [e.g., Authoritative and academic, engaging and conversational, formal and professional, practical and instructional.]
   *   **Approximate Desired Length (if known):** [e.g., 2000 words, 10-page report, etc. This helps gauge the level of detail for the outline.]
   *   **Call to Action (if any):** [What, if anything, should the reader do after consuming this content? (e.g., Download a related resource, contact sales, read another article).]

**2. Key Information & Focus Areas:**
   *   **Main Questions this Content Should Answer:** [List specific questions the target audience might have that this content should address.]
   *   **Specific Sub-topics or Sections to Include (if you have initial ideas):** [If you already have some thoughts on key sections or areas to cover, list them here. The AI can expand on these or suggest others.]
   *   **Sources of Information or Data to Reference (if known):** [Are there specific studies, reports, experts, or internal data that should be incorporated or referenced?]
   *   **Any Angles or Perspectives to Emphasize or Avoid:** [Are there particular viewpoints to highlight, or common misconceptions to address/debunk? Are there any sensitive topics to handle carefully or avoid?]
   *   **Competitor Content (Optional):** [If you know of existing similar content, you can mention 1-2 examples and what you want your piece to do differently or better.]

**3. Request for Detailed Content Outline:**

I need you to act as an expert content strategist, a skilled editor, and a subject matter expert (to the best of your ability based on the topic). Based on the information provided above, please generate a comprehensive and detailed hierarchical outline for this content piece. The outline should include:

*   **A. Proposed Title (Refined if necessary):**
    *   Offer alternative title suggestions if the provided one can be improved for clarity or impact.
*   **B. Introduction:**
    *   Hook/Opening: Suggestion for how to grab the reader's attention.
    *   Thesis Statement/Purpose: Clear statement of what the content will cover and why it's important.
    *   Roadmap: Brief overview of the main sections.
*   **C. Main Body Sections (e.g., Chapters, Parts, or H2-Level Headings):**
    *   For each main section:
        *   Suggest a clear and descriptive heading.
        *   **Sub-sections (e.g., H3/H4-Level Headings):** Break down each main section into logical sub-topics with their own headings.
        *   **Key Points/Talking Points/Data for Each Sub-section:** List 3-5 bullet points under each sub-section outlining the core information, arguments, examples, data points, or concepts to be covered.
        *   (Optional) Suggest where visuals (charts, diagrams, images) might be beneficial.
*   **D. Conclusion:**
    *   Summary of Key Takeaways: Briefly reiterate the main points or arguments.
    *   Final Thought/Implication: Offer a concluding thought or discuss broader implications.
    *   Call to Action (if applicable): Reinforce or introduce the desired next step for the reader.
*   **E. (Optional) Appendix / Glossary / Further Reading Suggestions:**
    *   If appropriate for the content type, suggest what might go into these sections.

Please ensure the outline flows logically, provides sufficient depth for the intended length, and directly addresses the goals and target audience needs. The more detail in the "Key Points" for each sub-section, the better.

I am looking for a robust framework that will serve as a strong foundation for writing the actual content.
