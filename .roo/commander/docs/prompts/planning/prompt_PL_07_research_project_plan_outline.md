Subject: **Request for Research Project Plan Outline: [Topic/Focus of Research]**

I require assistance in generating a high-level plan outline for a research project focused on: **[Topic/Focus of Research, e.g., 'Understanding Customer Churn Drivers', 'Market Sizing for New Product Category X', 'Usability Testing for Website Redesign Concepts', 'Competitor Landscape Analysis in Y Industry']**.

**1. Research Project Overview & Objectives:**
   *   **Research Project Title/Topic:** [Exact title or topic of the research.]
   *   **Primary Research Question(s):** [What specific question(s) is this research aiming to answer? Be as precise as possible.]
   *   **Key Objectives of the Research:** [What are the main goals? (e.g., Identify top 3 reasons for customer churn, estimate total addressable market for X, validate usability of new designs, understand competitor strengths/weaknesses).]
   *   **Target Audience for the Research Findings:** [Who will use the results of this research? (e.g., Product team, marketing department, senior leadership, sales team).]
   *   **Decisions to be Informed by this Research:** [What specific business or project decisions will this research help to make?]
   *   **Known Constraints or Limitations:** [e.g., Limited budget for external data, tight deadline for findings, access only to internal customer data, specific geographic focus.]
   *   **Desired Timeline for Research Completion:** [When are the findings needed?]

**2. Key Information & Scope:**
   *   **Target Subjects/Population (if applicable):** [Who or what will be studied? (e.g., Current customers who churned in last 6 months, potential users matching persona X, industry experts, competitor websites and marketing materials, publicly available market reports).]
   *   **Initial Thoughts on Research Methodology (if any):** [Do you have any preliminary ideas about how the research might be conducted? (e.g., Surveys, interviews, focus groups, secondary data analysis, usability testing, competitive intelligence gathering). The AI can also suggest methodologies.]
   *   **Key Information or Data Points to Collect:** [What specific types of information or data are crucial to answer the research questions?]
   *   **Scope of Research (Inclusions/Exclusions):** [What specific areas will be covered? What is explicitly out of scope?]

**3. Request for Research Project Plan Outline:**

I need you to act as an experienced research manager or consultant. Based on the information provided above, please generate a comprehensive high-level plan outline for this research project. The outline should cover key stages and activities necessary for conducting effective research. This should include, but not be limited to:

*   **A. Research Project Overview:**
    *   Restatement of Research Title, Primary Research Question(s), and Key Objectives.
*   **B. Scope Definition:**
    *   Key Inclusions (what the research WILL investigate).
    *   Key Exclusions (what the research will NOT investigate).
*   **C. Proposed Research Methodology:**
    *   Suggest appropriate primary and/or secondary research methods (e.g., surveys, in-depth interviews, focus groups, observational studies, competitor analysis, literature review, data mining).
    *   Briefly justify why these methods are suitable.
    *   Outline key considerations for each chosen method (e.g., sample size for surveys, recruitment criteria for interviews).
*   **D. Data Collection Plan:**
    *   **Sources of Data:** (e.g., Target participant groups, existing databases, public reports, competitor materials).
    *   **Instrumentation (if applicable):** (e.g., Outline key areas for a survey questionnaire or interview guide).
    *   **Recruitment Strategy (for primary research):** How will participants be found and screened?
    *   **Data Collection Process:** High-level steps for gathering the data.
*   **E. Data Analysis Plan:**
    *   How will qualitative data be analyzed (e.g., thematic analysis, content analysis)?
    *   How will quantitative data be analyzed (e.g., descriptive statistics, statistical tests - if applicable)?
    *   Tools or software that might be used for analysis.
*   **F. Estimated Timeline & Key Milestones:**
    *   Suggest major phases (e.g., Planning & Design, Recruitment, Data Collection, Analysis, Reporting).
    *   Propose key milestones for each phase.
*   **G. Resource Requirements (Categories):**
    *   Personnel (e.g., Researchers, analysts, recruiters, transcribers).
    *   Budget (for incentives, tools, external data).
    *   Tools/Technology (e.g., Survey platform, interview recording, data analysis software).
*   **H. Potential Challenges & Ethical Considerations:**
    *   Identify 2-3 potential challenges in conducting this research (e.g., low response rates, difficulty recruiting specific participants, bias in data collection).
    *   Outline key ethical considerations (e.g., informed consent, data privacy, anonymity/confidentiality).
*   **I. Deliverables & Reporting:**
    *   What will be the final output(s) of the research? (e.g., Comprehensive report, presentation deck, raw data set, list of recommendations).
    *   Outline key sections for a final research report.
*   **J. Roles & Responsibilities (High-Level):**
    *   Suggest key roles needed for the research project (e.g., Lead Researcher, Analyst, Project Manager).

Please present this outline in a clear, organized, and actionable format. The goal is to have a strategic framework for planning and executing the research project effectively.
