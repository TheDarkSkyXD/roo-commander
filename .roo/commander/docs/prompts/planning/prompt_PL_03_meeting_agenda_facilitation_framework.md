Subject: **Request for Meeting Agenda & Facilitation Framework: [Purpose/Name of Meeting]**

I require assistance in generating a detailed meeting agenda and a facilitation framework for an upcoming meeting: **[Purpose/Name of Meeting, e.g., 'Project Kickoff for Client Alpha', 'Weekly Marketing Team Strategy Session', 'Brainstorming Session for New Product Features', 'Quarterly Business Review with Leadership']**.

**1. Meeting Overview & Objectives:**
   *   **Meeting Title/Purpose:** [Clearly state the name and primary purpose of the meeting.]
   *   **Desired Outcome(s):** [What specific, tangible outcomes should be achieved by the end of this meeting? (e.g., "Decision made on X," "Action plan for Y developed," "All team members aligned on Z," "Feedback gathered on A," "Risks for B identified").]
   *   **Key Topics to Cover:** [List the main discussion points or agenda items that need to be addressed to achieve the desired outcomes.]
   *   **Attendees & Their Roles (if known):** [List key attendees or roles. Note if any specific individual is leading a particular topic or is a key decision-maker.]
   *   **Meeting Duration:** [Total allocated time for the meeting, e.g., 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 3 hours.]
   *   **Meeting Format:** [e.g., In-person, Virtual (Zoom, Teams), Hybrid.]
   *   **Any Known Constraints or Sensitivities:** [e.g., Limited time for a specific topic, differing opinions expected, need for pre-reading to be completed.]

**2. Preparatory Information:**
   *   **Pre-Reading Materials or Required Preparation (if any):** [What, if anything, should attendees review or prepare before the meeting? If so, describe or link to these materials.]
   *   **Decisions to be Made (if any):** [Explicitly list any specific decisions that need to be made during this meeting.]
   *   **Information to be Shared (if any specific items):** [List key pieces of information that need to be disseminated during the meeting.]

**3. Request for Meeting Agenda & Facilitation Framework:**

I need you to act as an expert meeting facilitator and planner. Based on the information provided above, please generate a detailed meeting agenda and a supporting facilitation framework. This should include:

*   **A. Meeting Title & Logistics:**
    *   Reiterate Meeting Title.
    *   Date, Time, Duration, Location/Virtual Link (as placeholders if not yet set).
    *   List of Invitees/Required Attendees (based on input).
*   **B. Meeting Objectives/Desired Outcomes:**
    *   Clearly list the 2-3 primary objectives for the meeting.
*   **C. Pre-Meeting Preparation for Attendees:**
    *   List any pre-reading or tasks attendees should complete.
*   **D. Detailed Timed Agenda:**
    *   For each agenda item:
        *   **Topic/Activity:** Clear description of the item.
        *   **Purpose of Item:** Why is this item on the agenda? What does it contribute to the overall meeting goal?
        *   **Lead:** Who is responsible for leading this agenda item/discussion? (If known, otherwise suggest "Facilitator" or "Topic Owner").
        *   **Allocated Time:** Suggested time in minutes.
        *   **(Optional) Desired Outcome for this specific item.**
*   **E. Facilitation Notes/Prompts (for key agenda items):**
    *   For critical discussion points or decision-making items, suggest:
        *   **Key Questions to Ask:** To stimulate discussion or guide thinking.
        *   **Potential Activities/Methods:** (e.g., Brainstorming technique, round-robin, pros/cons list, voting method if a decision is needed).
        *   **Things to Watch For:** (e.g., Ensure all voices are heard, keep discussion on track, manage dominant personalities, ensure psychological safety for differing opinions).
*   **F. Materials & Tools Needed:**
    *   List any materials (e.g., whiteboard, markers, sticky notes, projector) or digital tools (e.g., shared document, polling tool, virtual whiteboard software) required for the meeting.
*   **G. Roles During the Meeting (Suggested):**
    *   Facilitator (if not the main requestor).
    *   Note-Taker.
    *   Timekeeper (optional).
*   **H. Post-Meeting Actions:**
    *   Reminder to capture: Decisions Made, Action Items (with owners and due dates), Key Takeaways.
    *   Suggestion for distributing minutes/summary.

Please ensure the agenda flows logically, makes efficient use of time, and is designed to achieve the stated outcomes. The facilitation notes should provide practical guidance for running a productive and inclusive meeting.

I am looking for a comprehensive framework that will help ensure this meeting is well-prepared, effectively run, and achieves its purpose.
