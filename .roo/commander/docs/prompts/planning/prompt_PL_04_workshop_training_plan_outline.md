Subject: **Request for Workshop/Training Session Plan Outline: [Title/Topic of Session]**

I require assistance in generating a detailed plan outline for an upcoming workshop/training session: **[Title/Topic of Session, e.g., 'Leadership Skills Workshop for New Managers', 'Training on Using Our New CRM System', 'Creative Brainstorming Techniques Workshop', 'Customer Service Excellence Training']**.

**1. Session Overview & Objectives:**
   *   **Session Title/Topic:** [Exact title or topic of the workshop/training.]
   *   **Primary Learning Objective(s):** [What should participants know, understand, or be able to do by the end of this session? Be specific and action-oriented (e.g., "Participants will be able to apply the XYZ feedback model," "Attendees will understand the core features of the new CRM," "Participants will generate 3 new ideas using the SCAMPER technique").]
   *   **Target Audience/Participants:** [Describe the intended participants. What is their current role, experience level with the topic, and any specific needs or motivations for attending?]
   *   **Session Duration:** [Total allocated time for the session, e.g., 2 hours, half-day (4 hours), full-day (8 hours), 3-day workshop.]
   *   **Session Format:** [e.g., In-person interactive workshop, virtual instructor-led training (VILT), blended learning module, hands-on lab.]
   *   **Desired Atmosphere/Tone:** [e.g., Highly interactive and collaborative, focused and instructional, reflective and insightful, fun and energetic.]
   *   **Any Pre-existing Materials or Content to Incorporate:** [Are there existing slides, handouts, articles, or exercises that should be part of this session?]

**2. Key Information & Focus Areas:**
   *   **Key Concepts or Skills to be Covered:** [List the main topics, theories, models, or practical skills that need to be addressed to achieve the learning objectives.]
   *   **Specific Activities or Exercises (if you have initial ideas):** [If you already have some thoughts on interactive elements, group work, case studies, or practical exercises, list them here.]
   *   **Assessment or Knowledge Check Methods (if applicable):** [How will learning or understanding be assessed during or after the session? (e.g., Q&A, short quiz, practical demonstration, group presentation, feedback form).]
   *   **Logistical Considerations (if known):** [e.g., Number of participants, room setup requirements (for in-person), technology platform to be used (for virtual).]

**3. Request for Workshop/Training Session Plan Outline:**

I need you to act as an expert instructional designer and experienced facilitator. Based on the information provided above, please generate a comprehensive and detailed plan outline for this workshop/training session. The outline should include:

*   **A. Session Title & Overview:**
    *   Reiterate Session Title.
    *   Briefly state the overall purpose and primary learning objectives.
    *   Target Audience and Duration.
*   **B. Pre-Session Preparation (for Facilitator & Participants):**
    *   **Facilitator:** Key materials to prepare, room/tech setup checklist.
    *   **Participants:** Any pre-reading, pre-work, or mindset preparation.
*   **C. Detailed Session Agenda / Flow (with Timings):**
    *   Break the session into logical modules or segments.
    *   For each module/segment:
        *   **Module Title/Topic:** Clear description.
        *   **Learning Objective(s) for this Module:** What will participants achieve in this specific part?
        *   **Key Content/Talking Points:** Outline the core information to be delivered.
        *   **Activities/Exercises:** Describe the interactive elements (e.g., discussion, group work, role-play, case study, Q&A). Include instructions or prompts for the activity.
        *   **Materials/Tools Needed for this Module:** (e.g., Slides X-Y, handout Z, whiteboard, specific software).
        *   **Estimated Time:** Duration for this module.
    *   Include breaks as appropriate for the session length.
*   **D. Facilitation Notes & Tips (for key modules/activities):**
    *   Suggestions for engaging participants.
    *   Key questions to ask to stimulate discussion or check understanding.
    *   Potential challenges for a given activity and how to manage them.
    *   Tips for transitioning between modules smoothly.
*   **E. Materials & Resources List (Consolidated):**
    *   A checklist of all handouts, slides, props, software, or other resources needed for the entire session.
*   **F. Post-Session Activities & Follow-Up:**
    *   How learning will be reinforced or assessed after the session.
    *   Any follow-up resources or actions for participants.
    *   Plan for collecting feedback on the session itself.
*   **G. (Optional) Contingency Planning Snippets:**
    *   Brief ideas for handling common issues (e.g., technology failure, low participation, running out of time).

Please ensure the plan is engaging, interactive (where appropriate), and structured to maximize learning and achievement of the objectives within the given timeframe.

I am looking for a robust framework that will allow me to confidently prepare and deliver a high-impact workshop/training session.
