## AI Generation Task (To be performed by the AI based on your details above)

Please generate the following based on the details you provided above:

### 1. YouTube Title Suggestions (4-5 Options)
* Generate 4-5 distinct, engaging titles.
* Ensure titles include relevant keywords for your video's topic, main subject, or tool.
* Mention key subjects, technologies, or tasks shown (e.g., "Sourdough Baking," "Photoshop Tutorial," "Python Basics," "Camera Review").
* Vary the style (e.g., descriptive, question-based, benefit-focused, numbered list).

### 2. YouTube Description
* **Format:** Plain text suitable for copy-pasting into YouTube. Use emojis (like ‚ú®, üöÄ, üí°, üõ†Ô∏è, ‚è∞, üëá, üëç, üîî) and simple Unicode separators (like --- or `üîπ‚û°Ô∏è`) for structure and visual appeal where appropriate. Make sure timestamps are in a clickable format (MM:SS or HH:MM:SS). URLs and #hashtags should also be formatted correctly.
* **Content Structure:**
    * **Hook:** Start with an engaging sentence or two summarizing the video (use `[Brief Video Summary]`).
    * **Video Overview:** Briefly explain the main tasks, steps, or topics covered (use `[Key Tasks/Steps/Topics Covered]`).
    * **What You'll Discover/Learn:** Detail the specific features or key concepts showcased (use `[Specific Software/Tool Features or Key Concepts Highlighted (if applicable)]`). Use bullet points or emoji markers (üîπ).
    * **Tools/Resources Mentioned:** List the relevant tools, software, or key resources used (use `[Assets/Tools/Resources Used (if notable)]`).
    * **üîó Useful Links:**
        * (Example) Main Product/Software Discussed: `[Your Link Here]`
        * (Example) Related Article/Resource: `[Your Link Here]`
        * (Example) Your Website/Blog: `[Your Link Here]`
        * (Example) Support My Work (Patreon, Buy Me a Coffee, etc.): `[Your Link Here]`
        * (Example) Follow me on Social Media: `[Your Link Here]`
    * **‚è∞ Timestamps:** Clearly list the key moments using the provided `[Key Timestamps]`.
        * HH:MM:SS - Description from `[Key Timestamps]`
        * HH:MM:SS - Description from `[Key Timestamps]`
    * **Call to Action:** Include a prompt for comments, likes, and subscriptions (e.g., "üí¨ What are your biggest challenges with [Topic]? Let me know in the comments! üëá Don't forget to üëç like this video and üîî subscribe for more tutorials/reviews!").
    * **Hashtags:** Generate relevant hashtags (e.g., #YourMainTopic, #SpecificSoftwareOrTool, #Tutorial, #HowTo, #Guide, #Review, #DIY, #RelevantNicheKeyword, #VideoTopic).

### 3. Thumbnail Generation Prompt (Detailed)
* Generate a *detailed text prompt* suitable for an AI image generator (like Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion).
* The prompt should aim to create a visually interesting, topic-focused thumbnail.
* **Instructions for the Image AI should include:**
    * **Style/Mood:** (e.g., clean, modern, dynamic, informative, artistic, cinematic).
    * **Background:** (e.g., a clean, blurred representation of the subject matter, abstract colored background, relevant environment like a kitchen or a workshop, a stylized software interface if applicable).
    * **Key Elements:** Incorporate the `[Main Visual Element/Concept for Thumbnail]` from the video details. Consider abstractly representing the core idea or the main subject. If you have a logo or specific branding element, specify whether/how to include it or an abstract representation.
    * **Text Overlay:** Include clear, bold text. This could be a shortened version of your best title option or a compelling keyword phrase related to the video's core content (e.g., "Sourdough SIMPLIFIED," "MASTER Photoshop," "Python for BEGINNERS"). Specify a modern, readable font style.
    * **Color Palette:** Suggest contrasting, vibrant colors appropriate for the topic (e.g., earthy tones for baking, techy blues and purples for software, bright and inviting for lifestyle).
    * **Composition:** Suggest a dynamic and clear arrangement of elements that draws the eye. (e.g., rule of thirds, leading lines, central focus on the key element).

### Tone and Style
* The generated titles and description should be informative, engaging, and targeted towards your specific audience for this video.
* The thumbnail prompt should be descriptive and provide enough detail for an image AI to generate a relevant and eye-catching image.

### Final Output Format
* Provide the titles as a numbered list.
* Provide the description as a single block of formatted plain text, ready to copy and paste.
* Provide the thumbnail prompt as a single block of text.
