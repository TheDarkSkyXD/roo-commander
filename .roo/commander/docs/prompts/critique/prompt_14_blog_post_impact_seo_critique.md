    *   **External Linking:** Are there credible external links to support claims or provide further reading (if appropriate)?
    *   **URL Structure (if inferable/provided):** Is the URL clean, concise, and does it include the primary keyword?

*   **F. Engagement & User Experience:**
    *   Does the post encourage engagement (e.g., comments, shares)?
    *   Is the tone appropriate for the target audience and blog's voice?
    *   Are visuals (images, videos) used effectively to enhance understanding and break up text?

*   **G. Call to Action (CTA):**
    *   Is there a clear and relevant CTA? Is it appropriately placed?
