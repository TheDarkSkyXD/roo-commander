**3. Request for Critical Analysis & Improvement Suggestions:**

I need you to operate as an expert social media strategist, a skilled content creator, an engagement specialist, and a representative of the target audience.

    *   Does the strategy include elements for actively engaging with the audience (e.g., responding to comments, asking questions, running polls/quizzes)?
    *   Are there efforts to build a community around the brand?

*   **G. Call to Action (CTA) & Conversion Potential (if applicable):**
    *   Are CTAs clear, compelling, and appropriate for the platform and content?
