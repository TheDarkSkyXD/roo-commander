**2. Request for Explanation:**

*   **D. Focus & Relevance:**
    *   Focus on the core essence of the concept and its most important implications, especially any aspects highlighted for emphasis.
    *   Avoid getting bogged down in overly technical or tangential details unless critical for basic understanding by the target audience.

*   **E. Accuracy:**
    *   While simplifying, ensure the explanation remains fundamentally accurate and does not misrepresent the core principles of the concept.

*   **F. (Optional) Key Takeaways:**
    *   If appropriate for the desired length/format, summarize with 2-3 key takeaways that the target audience should remember.
