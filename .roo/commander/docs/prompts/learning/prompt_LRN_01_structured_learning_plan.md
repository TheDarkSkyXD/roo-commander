Subject: **Request for Structured Learning Plan: [Skill/Topic to Learn]**

I require a structured learning plan to acquire proficiency in/understanding of **[Skill/Topic to Learn, e.g., 'Python for Data Analysis', 'Fundamentals of UI/UX Design', 'Advanced Google Ads Campaign Management', 'The principles of Agile Project Management']**.

**1. Learning Context & Goals:**
   *   **Skill/Topic to Learn:** [Reiterate the specific skill or topic.]
   *   **Current Knowledge Level:** [Specify your current understanding or experience with this skill/topic (e.g., Absolute Beginner, Some Basic Knowledge, Intermediate - understand X but not Y, Familiar with related concepts but not this specific area).]
   *   **Desired Outcome/Proficiency Level:** [What do you want to be able to *do* or *understand* by the end of this learning plan? (e.g., "Be able to build simple Python scripts for data cleaning," "Confidently design wireframes and user flows for mobile apps," "Successfully set up and optimize Google Ads campaigns achieving a target ROAS," "Lead daily stand-ups and sprint planning sessions effectively").]
   *   **Primary Reason for Learning:** [e.g., Career development, new project requirement, personal interest, improve current job performance.]
   *   **Available Time Commitment:** [Approximately how many hours per week or per day can you dedicate to learning this? (e.g., "5-7 hours per week," "1 hour per day").]
   *   **Preferred Learning Duration (if any):** [Do you have a target timeframe to achieve the desired proficiency? (e.g., "Within 4 weeks," "Over the next 3 months," "No specific deadline, but steady progress preferred").]
   *   **Preferred Learning Styles/Resources (Optional):** [Do you have preferences? (e.g., "Prefer hands-on projects and video tutorials," "Learn best by reading and then applying," "Looking for free resources primarily," "Open to a mix of articles, interactive courses, and books").]

**2. Request for Learning Plan Structure:**

Please generate a structured learning plan that includes the following:

*   **A. Modular Breakdown:**
    *   Divide the learning into logical modules or weekly segments (based on the preferred duration, if provided, or suggest a reasonable timeframe like 4-8 weeks for foundational learning).
    *   For each module/week:
        *   **Key Topics/Concepts to Cover:** List the specific sub-topics or concepts to be learned.
        *   **Learning Objectives:** What should the learner be able to understand or do after completing this module/week?

*   **B. Suggested Learning Activities & Resource Types:**
    *   For each module/week, suggest types of learning activities (e.g., reading specific types of articles, watching tutorial series, completing interactive exercises, working on mini-projects).
    *   Recommend *types* of resources (e.g., "official documentation for [technology]," "beginner-friendly YouTube channels on [topic]," "interactive coding platforms like [example]," "project-based courses on platforms like [example]," "key industry blogs"). *Avoid recommending specific paid courses unless explicitly asked to consider them.*

*   **C. Practice & Application:**
    *   Suggest practical exercises, small projects, or real-world application ideas for each module/week to reinforce learning and build practical skills.

*   **D. Milestones & Progress Tracking:**
    *   Suggest potential milestones or checkpoints to help gauge progress and maintain motivation.
    *   Recommend ways the learner can self-assess their understanding (e.g., quizzes if resources provide them, ability to explain concepts, completing a capstone project).

*   **E. Tips for Effective Learning:**
    *   Include 2-3 general tips for staying motivated, overcoming common learning challenges related to this skill/topic, or making the learning process more effective.

Please ensure the plan is actionable, progressive (builds from fundamentals to more advanced concepts), and tailored to the provided context (especially current knowledge level and desired outcome).
