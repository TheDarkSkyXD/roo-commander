Subject: **Assistance Request: Scaffolding a New AI Prompt for [Briefly Describe Task/Purpose of New Prompt]**

I am working on creating a new, effective AI prompt and require your expert assistance in scaffolding its structure and ensuring it incorporates prompt engineering best practices.

**1. Overview of the New Prompt's Intended Purpose:**
   *   **Primary Goal of the New Prompt:** [What specific task do you want the AI to perform using the new prompt? What is the desired outcome or output? e.g., "Generate a marketing email," "Summarize a technical document," "Critique a design mockup," "Draft a project plan outline."]
   *   **Target User of the New Prompt (Who will be filling it out?):** [e.g., Marketing team members, project managers, developers, any employee.]
   *   **Target AI Model (if known, or general LLM capabilities):** [e.g., Gemini, GPT-4, Claude, or "a general-purpose advanced LLM."]
   *   **Why is this new prompt needed? What problem will it solve or what process will it improve?** [Provide brief justification.]

**2. Initial Thoughts or Requirements for the New Prompt (Optional):**
   *   **Key Information the User Must Provide in the New Prompt:** [What inputs or context will be essential for the AI to perform the task? e.g., "For an email prompt, the user must provide the target audience, key message, and desired CTA."]
   *   **Specific Style, Tone, or Persona for the AI's Output (if any):** [e.g., "The AI's output should be formal and professional," "The AI should adopt the persona of a helpful assistant."]
   *   **Known Constraints or Things to Avoid in the AI's Output:** [e.g., "The summary should not exceed 200 words," "The AI should avoid making financial projections."]
   *   **Desired Output Format (if specific):** [e.g., Markdown, JSON, bulleted list, a specific document structure.]

**3. Request for Scaffolding Assistance:**

I need you to act as an expert prompt engineer and instructional designer. Based on the information above, please help me create a comprehensive scaffold or structured outline for my new prompt. This scaffold should guide me in writing the actual prompt text and ensure I cover all necessary elements for an effective and robust prompt.

Please provide a scaffold that includes, but is not limited to, considerations for:

*   **A. Clear Role/Persona for the AI:**
    *   Suggestions for how to define the AI's role or persona to best suit the task.
    *   Example phrasing.

*   **B. Explicit Task Definition:**
    *   How to clearly and unambiguously state the primary task for the AI.
    *   Suggestions for action verbs and precise language.

*   **C. Essential Context & Input Sections:**
    *   What specific sections or placeholders should be included in the new prompt for the user to provide necessary background information, data, or context?
    *   How to guide the user to provide high-quality input.

*   **D. Output Specifications & Formatting Instructions:**
    *   How to clearly instruct the AI on the desired format, structure, length, and style of its output.
    *   Examples of how to request specific formats (e.g., JSON, Markdown with headers).

*   **E. Constraints & Negative Constraints:**
    *   How to define what the AI *should not* do or include.
    *   Examples of phrasing for constraints.

*   **F. Tone & Style Guidance for AI Output:**
    *   How to instruct the AI on the desired tone (e.g., formal, informal, empathetic, analytical).

*   **G. Use of Examples (Few-Shot Learning):**
    *   Guidance on whether few-shot examples would be beneficial for this type of prompt and, if so, how to structure them.

*   **H. Step-by-Step Instructions or Chain-of-Thought (if applicable):**
    *   If the task is complex, how to break it down into steps for the AI or encourage a chain-of-thought process.

*   **I. Iterative Refinement & Testing Notes:**
    *   Brief advice on how to test and refine the new prompt once drafted.

*   **J. Overall Structure & Flow of the New Prompt:**
    *   A recommended order for the sections within the new prompt for optimal clarity and effectiveness.

Please present this scaffold in a clear, organized manner, perhaps using headings and bullet points for each recommended section of the new prompt I am building. The goal is for me to use your scaffold as a detailed blueprint.

I am looking for a **comprehensive and actionable blueprint** that will help me construct a high-quality, effective AI prompt.
