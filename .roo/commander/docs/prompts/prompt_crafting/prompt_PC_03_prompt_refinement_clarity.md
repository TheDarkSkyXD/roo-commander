Subject: **Assistance Request: Refining and Enhancing Clarity of Draft AI Prompt for [Core Task of Draft Prompt]**

I have drafted an AI prompt intended to **[Core Task of Draft Prompt, e.g., 'generate social media captions', 'summarize meeting notes', 'write Python functions']**, and I require your expert assistance to refine its language, structure, and instructions for maximum clarity, effectiveness, and to minimize potential misinterpretation by an LLM.

**1. Draft Prompt for Review:**

```text
// Paste the ENTIRE text of your draft prompt here.
// Include any defined roles, instructions, context placeholders, output specifications, etc.

// Example Draft Prompt:
// "You are a helpful assistant. Write a short summary of the following text.
// Text: [User pastes text here]
// Make it about 3 sentences and easy to understand."
```

**2. Context for the Draft Prompt:**
   *   **Intended Primary Goal/Task:** [Reconfirm the main objective of this draft prompt.]
   *   **Target AI Model (if specific, or general LLM capabilities):** [e.g., Gemini, GPT-4, or "a general-purpose advanced LLM."]
   *   **Desired Output Characteristics (if not fully clear in the draft):** [e.g., "The summary should be neutral in tone," "The social media captions should include relevant hashtags."]
   *   **Specific Concerns or Areas of Uncertainty in the Draft Prompt:** [Are there any parts of your draft prompt you are particularly unsure about or want specific feedback on? e.g., "I'm not sure if my instruction for length is clear enough," "Is the persona too generic?"]

**3. Request for Refinement & Clarity Enhancement:**

I need you to act as an expert prompt engineer with a keen eye for detail, language precision, and LLM behavior. Please meticulously review my draft prompt (provided in Section 1) and its context (Section 2).

Provide specific, actionable feedback and suggestions to:

*   **A. Improve Clarity & Reduce Ambiguity:**
    *   Identify any words, phrases, or instructions in the draft prompt that could be unclear, ambiguous, or open to multiple interpretations by an LLM.
    *   Suggest more precise or explicit alternative phrasings.

*   **B. Enhance Task Explicitness:**
    *   Does the prompt clearly and directly state what the AI is expected to do?
    *   Suggest ways to make the core task instruction more direct and unmistakable.

*   **C. Strengthen Role/Persona Definition (if applicable):**
    *   If a role/persona is defined, is it effective for the task? Could it be more specific or impactful?
    *   If no role is defined, would adding one be beneficial, and what might it be?

*   **D. Optimize Context & Input Guidance:**
    *   Are the placeholders or instructions for user-provided input clear?
    *   Could the prompt better guide the user on the type and quality of input needed?

*   **E. Refine Output Specifications:**
    *   Are instructions regarding the desired output format, length, style, structure, etc., clear and enforceable?
    *   Suggest improvements for how to specify output requirements more effectively.

*   **F. Bolster Constraints & Negative Constraints:**
    *   Are existing constraints clear? Are any important constraints missing?
    *   How can negative constraints (what the AI *should not* do) be phrased more effectively?

*   **G. Improve Overall Structure & Flow:**
    *   Is the information in the draft prompt organized logically?
    *   Would reordering sections or instructions improve its effectiveness?

*   **H. Incorporate Prompt Engineering Best Practices:**
    *   Are there any general prompt engineering best practices that are not currently utilized but would benefit this prompt (e.g., use of delimiters, step-by-step instruction for complex tasks, explicit encouragement of desired behaviors)?

*   **I. Suggest a Revised Version (Optional but Encouraged):**
    *   If you have significant suggestions, please feel free to offer a fully revised version of the prompt incorporating your recommended changes.

My goal is to transform my draft prompt into a highly effective, robust, and clear set of instructions for an AI. Please provide concrete examples and explain the rationale behind your suggestions.

I am looking for **detailed and actionable feedback** to significantly elevate the quality of my draft prompt.
