Subject: **Assistance Request: Brainstorming Elements for a New AI Prompt on [Core Task of New Prompt]**

I am in the process of designing a new AI prompt to accomplish the core task of **[Clearly state the primary function of the new prompt you are building, e.g., 'generating marketing email copy', 'summarizing legal documents', 'creating Python code snippets', 'providing customer service responses']**.

I need your expert assistance to brainstorm various options and considerations for the key elements that will make up this new prompt.

**1. Core Task & Objective of the New Prompt:**
   *   **Primary Function:** [Reiterate the core task, e.g., "Generate a subject line and body for a promotional email."]
   *   **Desired Outcome/Output Quality:** [What defines a successful output from this new prompt? e.g., "The email should be persuasive, concise, and have a clear call to action," "The code should be efficient and well-commented."]
   *   **Target AI Model (if known, or general LLM capabilities):** [e.g., Gemini, GPT-4, or "a general-purpose advanced LLM."]

**2. Specific Prompt Elements for Brainstorming:**

I would like you to brainstorm and provide multiple suggestions (e.g., 3-5 diverse options where applicable) for each of the following elements of my new prompt. Please explain the potential benefits or implications of each suggestion.

*   **A. AI Persona / Role Definition:**
    *   *Current thought (if any):* [My initial idea for the AI's role, or "None yet"]
    *   **Brainstorm:** Suggest diverse and effective personas or roles the AI could adopt to best perform the core task. (e.g., "Expert Copywriter," "Concise Technical Summarizer," "Helpful Customer Support Agent," "Creative Storyteller").

*   **B. Phrasing of the Core Task Instruction:**
    *   *Current thought (if any):* [My initial idea for how to instruct the AI, or "None yet"]
    *   **Brainstorm:** Suggest different ways to clearly and unambiguously phrase the main instruction or command to the AI. Consider variations in directness, politeness, or emphasis.

*   **C. Essential Context & Input Variables:**
    *   *Current thought (if any):* [What inputs I think are needed, or "None yet"]
    *   **Brainstorm:** What specific pieces of information, context, or input variables would be crucial for the user to provide within the new prompt to enable the AI to perform the task effectively? Think broadly about what could influence the output quality.

*   **D. Output Format Specification:**
    *   *Current thought (if any):* [My initial idea for the output format, or "None yet"]
    *   **Brainstorm:** Suggest various ways to instruct the AI on the desired output format (e.g., specific instructions for Markdown, JSON structure, bullet points, numbered lists, specific sections/headings, a conversational response).

*   **E. Key Constraints & Negative Constraints:**
    *   *Current thought (if any):* [Any constraints I've considered, or "None yet"]
    *   **Brainstorm:** What important constraints (what the AI *should* do or adhere to) and negative constraints (what the AI *should avoid*) would be beneficial to include for this task? (e.g., word count, tone to avoid, topics to exclude, level of detail).

*   **F. Tone & Style Modifiers:**
    *   *Current thought (if any):* [My initial idea for tone/style, or "None yet"]
    *   **Brainstorm:** Suggest different keywords or phrases that could be used to guide the AI's tone and style for the output (e.g., "formal," "witty," "empathetic," "data-driven," "concise," "elaborate").

*   **G. Potential Few-Shot Examples (Conceptual):**
    *   *Current thought (if any):* [Whether I think examples are needed, or "None yet"]
    *   **Brainstorm:** For this core task, what kind of input/output pairs would make effective few-shot examples to guide the AI's behavior or style? (Describe the *type* of examples, not necessarily the full examples themselves).

*   **H. Advanced Techniques to Consider:**
    *   *Current thought (if any):* [Any advanced techniques I'm aware of, or "None yet"]
    *   **Brainstorm:** Are there any advanced prompt engineering techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought, self-critique, step-by-step instructions, asking for justifications) that might be particularly beneficial for this core task?

**3. Request for Brainstorming Assistance:**

Please act as an expert prompt engineer. For each element listed in Section 2 (A-H), provide a diverse set of well-reasoned suggestions. My goal is to explore a range of possibilities so I can select the most effective components when I draft the full new prompt.

I am looking for **creative and practical ideas** for each prompt element to help me build a highly effective new AI prompt.
