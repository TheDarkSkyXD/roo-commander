Subject: **Assistance Request: Crafting an Effective AI Persona for a Prompt on [Core Task of New Prompt]**

I am developing a new AI prompt to perform the core task of **[Core Task of New Prompt, e.g., 'writing persuasive sales copy', 'explaining complex technical concepts simply', 'generating creative story ideas', 'providing empathetic customer support']**.

To enhance the quality and appropriateness of the AI's output, I want to define a specific persona for the AI to adopt. I need your expert assistance in crafting this persona description.

**1. Overview of the New Prompt's Core Task & Desired Output Style:**
   *   **Primary Function of the New Prompt:** [Reiterate the core task clearly, e.g., "Generate compelling product descriptions for e-commerce listings."]
   *   **Target Audience for the AI's Output:** [Who will be reading or consuming what the AI generates? e.g., "Potential online shoppers," "Non-technical managers," "Young adult readers."]
   *   **Desired Tone of the AI's Output:** [e.g., Professional, witty, empathetic, enthusiastic, neutral, academic, conversational.]
   *   **Desired Style of the AI's Output:** [e.g., Concise, detailed, storytelling, data-driven, poetic, direct.]
   *   **Key Objective of the AI's Communication:** [What should the AI's response achieve with the target audience? e.g., Persuade to buy, simplify understanding, inspire creativity, resolve an issue with care.]
   *   **Target AI Model (if known, or general LLM capabilities):** [e.g., Gemini, GPT-4, or "a general-purpose advanced LLM."]

**2. Initial Thoughts on the AI Persona (if any):**
   *   [Do you have a preliminary idea for the persona? e.g., "I was thinking of something like a 'helpful expert guide'," or "A 'creative muse'," or "A very formal 'corporate spokesperson'." If no ideas yet, state "None yet."]

**3. Request for Persona Crafting Assistance:**

I need you to act as an expert in character development, communication strategy, and prompt engineering. Based on the information above, please help me craft one or more detailed and effective persona descriptions that I can include in my new prompt.

For each persona suggestion, please consider and include (where applicable):

*   **A. Role Title/Descriptor:**
    *   A clear and evocative title for the persona (e.g., "Expert Marketing Copywriter," "Patient Technical Explainer," "Seasoned Travel Advisor," "Innovative Product Designer").

*   **B. Key Attributes & Expertise:**
    *   What specific knowledge, skills, or areas of expertise should this persona embody?
    *   What qualities define their approach (e.g., analytical, creative, meticulous, empathetic, strategic)?

*   **C. Communication Style & Tone:**
    *   Detailed description of their speaking/writing style (e.g., uses analogies, avoids jargon, direct and to-the-point, uses humor appropriately, formal and respectful).
    *   Specific adjectives to describe their tone.

*   **D. Motivations & Goals (from the persona's perspective):**
    *   What drives this persona? What are they trying to achieve *for the user* of the prompt? (e.g., "To make complex topics easily accessible," "To inspire groundbreaking ideas," "To ensure every customer feels heard and valued.")

*   **E. Language & Vocabulary Preferences:**
    *   Should the persona use specific types of language (e.g., industry-specific terms if appropriate, simple and clear language, evocative and descriptive words)?
    *   Are there any words or phrases the persona should favor or avoid?

*   **F. Example Phrasing (Illustrative Snippet):**
    *   A very short example (1-2 sentences) of how this persona might introduce itself or begin a response, to illustrate its character.
    *   Example: For an "Expert Marketing Copywriter": *"Alright, let's craft some copy that doesn't just sell, it sings! Tell me about your product..."*

*   **G. Why this Persona is Effective for the Task:**
    *   Briefly explain how adopting this persona will help the AI better perform the core task and achieve the desired output characteristics.

Please provide 1-3 distinct persona options if possible, especially if different approaches could be viable. The goal is to have a rich, well-defined persona description that I can directly use or adapt for my prompt.

I am looking for **vivid, actionable persona descriptions** that will effectively guide the AI's behavior and output.
