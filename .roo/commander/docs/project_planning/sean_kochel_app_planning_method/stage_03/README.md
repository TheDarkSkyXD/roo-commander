# README: Stage 3 - Detailed Implementation Plan

## 1. Purpose of this Directory

This directory, `./` (relative to `.roo/commander/docs/project_planning/sean_kochel_app_planning_method/stage_03/`), contains all documents related to **Stage 3: Detailed Implementation Plan** of the Sean Kochel AI-Assisted App Planning Method. The objective of this stage is to synthesize the outputs from Stage 1 (Architecture) and Stage 2 (Design) into actionable, detailed technical specifications that developers can use to build the application. This includes defining file structures, API endpoints, database schemas, and specific implementation logic for each feature. This stage corresponds to the AI prompt for "Details."

## 2. Overview of Contents / Key Files & Subdirectories

The key documents produced during this stage are:

*   **[./01_overall_technical_specification_file_structure.md](./01_overall_technical_specification_file_structure.md)**: Outlines the overall technical principles, the proposed file system structure for both frontend and backend, core technology stack choices, API design philosophy, database design approach, and high-level strategies for error handling, security, testing, and CI/CD.
*   **[./02_feature_specific_technical_implementation_guide.md](./02_feature_specific_technical_implementation_guide.md)**: This document (or a series of similarly named documents, one per feature, e.g., `02a_feature_auth_tech_guide.md`, `02b_feature_capture_tech_guide.md`) provides a granular technical breakdown for *each* MVP feature. It details:
    *   Feature Goal & User Stories
    *   API Relationships & Dependencies
    *   Detailed Functional Requirements (technical perspective)
    *   Frontend Component Structure & Files
    *   Frontend State Management Details
    *   Frontend Navigation Flow Specifics
    *   Backend API Endpoint Design (request/response, auth)
    *   Relevant Database Schema portions & SQL
    *   Key Logic & Pseudocode examples
    *   Data Flow Diagrams (conceptual)
    *   Key Edge Cases
    *   Specific Security, Testing, and Logging considerations for the feature.

## 3. Usage Notes / How to Contribute (If Applicable)

*   The "Overall Technical Specification & File Structure" document should be established first as it sets the global context for the feature-specific guides.
*   A separate "Feature-Specific Technical Implementation Guide" should be created for each distinct feature defined in the MVP.
*   These documents are the final planning step before coding begins and should be as detailed as possible to minimize ambiguity during development.

## 4. Related Documents

*   Parent Method Overview: [../README.md](./../README.md)
*   Stage 1 Documents: [../stage_01/README.md](../stage_01/README.md)
*   Stage 2 Documents: [../stage_02/README.md](../stage_02/README.md)

## 5. Maintenance

This `README.md` should be updated if the list or purpose of the Stage 3 documents changes, or if the approach to creating feature-specific guides is altered.
