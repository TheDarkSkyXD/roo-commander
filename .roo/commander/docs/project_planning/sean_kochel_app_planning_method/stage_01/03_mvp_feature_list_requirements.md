*   **Technology Involved:**
    *   **Frontend:** React Native (Expo), Expo Camera, Expo ImagePicker, Expo ImageManipulator (for cropping, rotation, compression).
    *   **Backend:** FastAPI endpoint for receiving image uploads.
    *   **Storage:** Cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Supabase Storage) for temporary or permanent image storage (decision pending based on architecture consideration for CDN).
*   **Main Overall Requirements Satisfied:**
    *   Provides critical visual input for the AI recipe generation.
    *   User-friendly image handling.
    *   Optimized image data for efficient processing.

### 2.3. Feature 3: Dish Information Input

*   **Summary:** Provides structured input fields for users to add the menu description of the dish and their personal tasting notes, complementing the visual information from the photo.
*   **Core Functional Requirements:**
    *   Dedicated text input field for "Menu Description."
    *   Dedicated text input field for "Personal Tasting Notes."
    *   Ability to save draft inputs locally before submission.
    *   Clear indication of required vs. optional fields (if any).
*   **Technology Involved:**
    *   **Frontend:** React Native (Expo) UI components (TextInput), local device storage (e.g., AsyncStorage) for draft saving.
    *   **Backend:** FastAPI endpoints to receive and process textual data.
*   **Main Overall Requirements Satisfied:**
    *   Provides essential textual context for AI recipe generation.
    *   Allows users to capture specific details of their dining experience.

### 2.4. Feature 4: AI Recipe Generation & Display

*   **Summary:** The core engine that processes the user's inputs (photo, description, notes) via an AI model to generate a detailed recipe, which is then presented to the user.
*   **Core Functional Requirements:**
    *   Securely transmit user inputs to the AI backend.
    *   AI model (e.g., GPT-4 Vision) analyzes multimodal inputs.
    *   AI generates a recipe including: title, ingredient list (with quantities), step-by-step instructions, and cooking techniques.
    *   Display loading/processing indicators to the user during generation.
    *   Present the generated recipe in a clear, easily readable, and structured format on the user's device.
