## 1. Introduction / Overview üéØ

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) flow for the "Michelin Star Recipe Guide App." It details the core step-by-step journey a user will take when interacting with the initial version of the application. This flow is designed to validate the primary value proposition: enabling users to generate recipes for restaurant dishes they've experienced. The steps are based on the AI-assisted planning session demonstrated by Sean Kochel, particularly the "Architect" prompt output.

## 2. Core MVP User Flow üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The following steps describe the envisioned core user experience for the MVP:

1.  **User Registration/Authentication:**
    *   The user launches the app.
    *   The user registers for a new account (e.g., using email/password) or logs into an existing account. Authentication will be handled via a backend service (e.g., Supabase Auth).
    *   Upon successful login/registration, the user is directed to the main app interface.

2.  **Navigate to Dish Input Feature:**
    *   The user navigates to the feature for inputting a new dish. In the video's example (07:38), this was envisioned via a bottom tab, potentially a "Camera" tab or an "Add Dish" tab.

3.  **Capture/Upload Dish Image:**
    *   The user either:
        *   Takes a live photograph of a dish using the device's camera through the app interface.
        *   Uploads an existing photograph of a dish from their device's photo gallery.

4.  **Input Dish Details:**
    *   The user is presented with fields to input:
        *   **Menu Description:** The exact description of the dish as it appeared on the restaurant menu.
        *   **Personal Tasting Notes:** The user's subjective observations about the dish (e.g., flavors, textures, presentation, suspected ingredients).

5.  **Submit for Recipe Generation:**
    *   The user submits the captured image and textual details.
    *   The application sends the image, menu description, and tasting notes to the backend AI recipe generation service (e.g., GPT-4 Vision API).

6.  **Recipe Processing & Display:**
    *   The system processes the request. The user may see a loading or processing indicator.
    *   The AI analyzes the inputs and generates a detailed recipe.
    *   The application receives the generated recipe and displays it to the user in a clean, readable format. This includes:
        *   Recipe Title
        *   List of Ingredients (with quantities)
        *   Step-by-step cooking instructions/techniques.

7.  **Review and Initial Actions on Recipe:**
    *   The user reviews the generated recipe.
    *   **MVP Action 1: Save Recipe:** The user has the option to save the generated recipe to their personal recipe collection within the app for later access.
    *   **(Potential MVP Action 2 / Early Post-MVP): Share Recipe:** Basic functionality to share the recipe (e.g., text, link) might be considered for MVP if simple to implement.
    *   **(Post-MVP for complex modifications): Request Modifications:** The ability for users to request AI-driven modifications (e.g., dietary adjustments, difficulty changes, ingredient substitutions) is noted as a desirable feature, likely for post-MVP development due to its complexity.

8.  **Access Saved Recipes:**
    *   The user can navigate to a "Recipe List" or "My Recipes" section (potentially another bottom tab as per 07:38) to view their collection of previously saved recipes.

## 3. Key Assumptions for MVP Flow ü§î

The successful execution of this MVP flow relies on several assumptions:
*   The user has a stable internet connection for AI processing and data synchronization.
*   The AI recipe generation service (e.g., GPT-4 Vision API) is accessible and can return a recipe within a reasonable timeframe.
*   The quality of the generated recipe is sufficient to be considered valuable by the user, even in its initial MVP stage.
*   Basic image upload and camera functionalities are reliably implemented on the mobile platform.

## 4. Conclusion / Summary ‚úÖ

The MVP flow for the "Michelin Star Recipe Guide App" focuses on the core loop of capturing dish information, AI-driven recipe generation, and recipe review/storage. This sequence is designed to provide immediate value to the user and gather essential feedback for refining the AI and iterating on the application's features. Subsequent versions will build upon this core flow by adding more sophisticated features like advanced recipe modification, social sharing, and community elements.
