## 1. Introduction / Overview üéØ

This document serves as a log for critical clarifying questions and architectural considerations identified during the initial planning phase of the "Michelin Star Recipe Guide App." It captures questions posed by the AI planning assistant (e.g., Claude) or the development team that require further discussion and decision-making. It also lists key architectural areas where strategic choices need to be made to ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable system. This is a living document that will be updated as decisions are made and new considerations arise.

## 2. Clarifying Questions for Architecture (Generated by AI/Team) ‚ùì

These are questions that emerged from the AI-assisted architectural planning (as seen in the video around 11:22 and onwards), which need to be addressed:

### 2.1. OpenAI API & Budget
*   **Q1:** What's your target budget for OpenAI API costs during the MVP phase? (Affects decisions on rate limiting, model choice, and free tier scope).
*   **Q2:** How many recipe generations should free users get (if a free tier is planned for MVP)? This directly impacts OpenAI costs and user management logic.

### 2.2. User Experience & Functionality
*   **Q3:** Do you want users to be able to edit/refine recipes *after* generation in the MVP? (Impacts complexity, data storage, and AI interaction).
*   **Q4:** Should the app work offline for viewing saved recipes in the MVP? (Adds complexity for local storage and synchronization).
*   **Q5:** Do you need any dietary restriction handling in MVP, or can that wait for Post-MVP? (Influences initial data model and AI prompting).
*   **Q6:** Should recipes include estimated cooking time and difficulty ratings in the MVP? (Requires additional AI prompting or data sourcing).
*   **Q7:** How will users find old recipes? Is full-text search on ingredients/descriptions needed, potentially requiring a service like Elasticsearch (Post-MVP)?

### 2.3. Data & Content
*   **Q8:** What image quality/size limits should we set for uploads? (Impacts storage costs, processing time, and API payload sizes).
*   **Q9:** Should we store uploaded images long-term or just during processing? (Impacts storage strategy and costs).

### 2.4. Technical & Scalability
*   **Q10:** What's your expected user base size at launch? (Affects infrastructure decisions, database scaling, and API rate limit planning).
*   **Q11:** How should the system handle errors when OpenAI is down or returns poor/nonsensical results? (Requires robust error handling and potentially fallback mechanisms).

## 3. Key Architectural Considerations & Decisions (To Be Made/Tracked) ‚öñÔ∏è

These are areas where deliberate architectural decisions are required. The initial choices from the video are noted, but these may evolve.

### 3.1. Deployment Platform
*   **Consideration:** Choice of platform for hosting the FastAPI backend.
*   **Initial Thought (from video):** Recommend Railway or Render for simplicity, or AWS/GCP for scalability. Railway offers an easy Docker deployment experience.
*   **Decision/Status:** [To be filled: e.g., "Decided: Railway for MVP due to ease of use and cost-effectiveness."]

### 3.2. Image Storage & Delivery
*   **Consideration:** How and where to store user-uploaded images and how to deliver them efficiently to the app.
*   **Initial Thought (from video):** Consider CloudFront + S3 for image CDN if keeping them long-term. Supabase Storage for MVP might be simpler.
*   **Decision/Status:** [To be filled]

### 3.3. Rate Limiting
*   **Consideration:** Implementing rate limits for API endpoints, especially those interacting with costly services like OpenAI.
*   **Initial Thought (from video):** Affects OpenAI costs and user management logic.
*   **Decision/Status:** [To be filled: e.g., "MVP will implement a limit of X recipe generations per user per day for free tier."]

### 3.4. Caching Strategy
*   **Consideration:** Implementing caching for generated recipes or frequently accessed data to reduce API costs and improve performance.
*   **Initial Thought (from video):** Redis could help reduce API costs for re-processing identical images/requests.
*   **Decision/Status:** [To be filled]

### 3.5. Error Handling & Logging
*   **Consideration:** Comprehensive strategy for handling errors (API errors, AI errors, network errors) and logging for debugging and monitoring.
*   **Initial Thought (from video):** Need structured logs, alerts, and potential recovery mechanisms.
*   **Decision/Status:** [To be filled]

### 3.6. Search & Discovery
*   **Consideration:** How users will find and rediscover saved recipes.
*   **Initial Thought (from video):** Basic list view for MVP. Full-text search (e.g., Elasticsearch) for Post-MVP.
*   **Decision/Status:** [To be filled]

### 3.7. Monitoring
*   **Consideration:** Tools and practices for monitoring application health, performance, and API usage.
*   **Initial Thought (from video):** Consider PostHog for analytics, Sentry for error tracking.
*   **Decision/Status:** [To be filled]

### 3.8. CI/CD Pipeline
*   **Consideration:** Automating the build, test, and deployment process.
*   **Initial Thought (from video):** GitHub Actions with Expo EAS for mobile deployment and automated testing for the FastAPI backend.
*   **Decision/Status:** [To be filled]

### 3.9. Database Schema Evolution & Migrations
*   **Consideration:** How database schema changes will be managed as the app evolves.
*   **Initial Thought (from video):** Using Alembic for migrations with SQLAlchemy ORM.
*   **Decision/Status:** [To be filled]

### 3.10. Security Considerations
*   **Consideration:** Ensuring security across the application (authentication, data sanitization, API protections).
*   **Initial Thought (from video):** Secure token management, OWASP password requirements, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, CSRF protection.
*   **Decision/Status:** [To be filled]

## 4. Action Items & Next Steps ‚û°Ô∏è

*   [ ] Discuss and answer all clarifying questions listed in Section 2.
*   [ ] Make and document decisions for each architectural consideration in Section 3.
*   [ ] Update relevant documents (Project Definition, MVP Features, System Architecture) based on these decisions.
*   [ ] Assign owners and deadlines for unresolved questions/decisions.

## 5. Conclusion / Summary ‚úÖ

This log provides a centralized place to track and resolve key architectural questions and decisions. By systematically addressing these points, the development team can build a more resilient, scalable, and well-understood application. This document will be continuously updated throughout the early planning and development phases.
