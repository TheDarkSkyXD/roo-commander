## 1. Introduction / Overview ðŸŽ¯

This document provides detailed UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) specifications for each screen and its various states within the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the "Michelin Star Recipe Guide App." It aims to guide frontend development by clearly defining the elements, interactions, and information flow for the user.

**Note:** Visual mockups, wireframes, or interactive prototypes (e.g., from Figma) should accompany this document. Placeholders `[Visual Mockup/Wireframe for SCREEN_NAME - STATE_NAME]` are used below to indicate where these visuals would be referenced.

## 2. General UI/UX Guidelines Reminder

All screens and components must adhere to the principles and styles defined in the **Comprehensive Design Brief & Style Guide**, including:
*   Color Palette
*   Typography (hierarchy, sizing, weights)
*   Iconography
*   Layout & Spacing (8pt grid)
*   Motion & Animation (subtle, purposeful)
*   Accessibility (A11y) standards

## 3. Feature 1: User Authentication & Onboarding

### 3.1. Welcome Screen

## 9. Conclusion / Summary âœ…

This Screen States & UI/UX Specification document provides a detailed blueprint for the MVP of the "Michelin Star Recipe Guide App." It should be used in conjunction with visual mockups and the overarching Design Brief & Style Guide to ensure a consistent, intuitive, and high-quality user experience. This document is expected to be updated and refined as the project progresses through development and user testing.
