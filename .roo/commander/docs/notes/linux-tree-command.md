You can use the `-I` option (uppercase "i") with `tree` to ignore directories or files matching a given pattern.

The command would be:

```bash
tree -a -I '.git' > 00-full-workspace-tree.txt
```

**Explanation:**

*   `tree`: The command itself.
*   `-a`: Shows all files, including hidden ones (like `.git`).
*   `-I '.git'`: This is the key part.
    *   `-I` tells `tree` to ignore files or directories matching the pattern.
    *   `'.git'` is the pattern. We quote it to ensure the shell doesn't try to interpret any special characters (though not strictly necessary for just `.git`). `tree` will ignore any file or directory named exactly `.git`.
*   `> 00-full-workspace-tree.txt`: Redirects the output of the `tree` command to the specified file.

**To ignore multiple patterns:**

You can separate multiple patterns with a pipe `|` symbol, and enclose the whole pattern string in quotes:

```bash
tree -a -I '.git|node_modules|__pycache__' > 00-full-workspace-tree.txt
```
This would exclude `.git` folders, `node_modules` folders, and `__pycache__` folders.

Remember to check `man tree` for all available options and more details on pattern matching.
