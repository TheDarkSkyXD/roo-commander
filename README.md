Welcome to Roo Commander, a streamlined, intelligent orchestration system designed to manage complex workflows by leveraging specialized AI modes. This iteration introduces the **"Manager + Squad"** architectural pattern, with the initial flagship implementation being the **`manager-data-product`** for guiding the design of Data Product Proofs of Concept (PoCs).

## Purpose & Vision 🎯

The **Roo Commander** system aims to:

*   Provide a **lean, adaptable core orchestrator** (`roo-commander`) responsible for high-level user interaction and session management.
*   Enable **modular, domain-specific workflow management** through specialized "Manager" modes (e.g., `manager-data-product`).
*   Utilize "Squad" modes (e.g., `data-product-strategist`, `data-product-ideator`) under each Manager to perform focused, expert tasks.
*   Ensure **traceability and context preservation** through a robust session management system with detailed logs and linked artifacts.
*   Standardize task delegation and tracking using **Markdown-Driven Task Management (MDTM)**.
*   Create a **scalable and maintainable architecture** where new capabilities can be added by developing new "Manager + Squad" units.

The vision is a powerful yet intuitive system that assists users in achieving complex goals by intelligently coordinating a team of specialized AI agents.

## Core Architectural Concepts 🏗️

Understanding these concepts is key to using and extending Roo Commander:

1.  **Orchestrator (`roo-commander`):** The primary user-facing AI. It initiates sessions, understands high-level user goals, and delegates to the appropriate Manager mode.
2.  **Manager Modes (e.g., `manager-data-product`):** Domain-specific orchestrators. They receive a high-level objective (as an MDTM task) from `roo-commander` and manage a "squad" of specialist modes to achieve it.
3.  **Squad Modes (e.g., `data-product-strategist`):** Specialist worker AIs that perform specific tasks assigned by their Manager mode, typically producing a defined artifact.
4.  **MDTM (Markdown-Driven Task Management):** The standardized system for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks. Tasks are defined in TOML+Markdown files and form the basis of delegation between modes.
5.  **Sessions & Artifacts:** Each user interaction or workflow execution occurs within a "session," which has a dedicated directory (`.roo/commander/sessions/[SESSION_ID]/`). This directory contains a `session_log.md` and an `artifacts/` subdirectory for all generated notes, design documents, and other contextual files, ensuring full traceability.
6.  **Knowledge Bases (KBs):** Each mode (`roo-commander`, Managers, Squad members) has its own KB (`kb/` subdirectory) containing its specific operational procedures, prompts, references, and domain knowledge.

## Key Capabilities (with `manager-data-product`) 💡

Initially, Roo Commander, in conjunction with `manager-data-product` and its squad, provides a guided workflow to:

*   Define the **strategy** for a new Data Product PoC.
*   Brainstorm **ideas and scope** for the PoC.
*   Develop detailed **user personas**.
*   Design a **simulated data schema** and describe sample data.
*   Conceptualize the **PoC user interface**.
*   Consolidate all findings into a comprehensive **Data Product PoC Plan**.

## Target Audience 👥

*   **Users of the Data Product Design Workflow:** Product Managers, Data Strategists, UX Designers, Analysts.
*   **Developers & Maintainers of Roo Commander:** Those looking to understand its architecture or extend it with new Manager and Squad modes.
*   **AI Interaction Designers:** Interested in multi-agent orchestration patterns.

## Getting Started 🏁

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a compatible Roo Code environment.
2.  **Explore the Documentation:**
    *   To understand the **overall architecture and concepts**, start with:
        *   `docs/introduction/00_overview.md`
        *   `docs/architecture/README.md`
    *   To learn how to **use the Data Product Design workflow**, see:
        *   `docs/user_guides/01_getting_started_with_data_product_design.md`
    *   For **developers looking to extend the system**, refer to:
        *   `docs/developer_guides/README.md`
3.  **Initiate Interaction:** Start interacting with `@roo-commander` in your Roo Code environment. It will present you with initial options.
