Add entries to the Pending Commits section with Status: wait.\n5. Group closely related files together if they meet ALL of the following criteria:\n   - Files were modified as part of the same logical change (e.g., implementing a single feature)\n   - Files have strong functional dependencies (e.g., a module and its test file)\n   - Changes across the files follow the same pattern or purpose\n   - You are absolutely certain the changes should be committed together\n   Example: If changes were made to both `user_model.py` and `test_user_model.py` to implement a new user attribute, these should be grouped. However, if `user_model.py` and `payment_service.py` were both modified, they likely represent separate logical changes and should NOT be grouped unless explicitly related.\n6. For grouped files, create a single commit message that clearly explains the unified purpose, followed by file-specific notes (e.g., \"feat(user): Add email verification - user_model.py: Add email field and validation - test_user_model.py: Add tests for email validation\").\n7. Ask for approval of all commit messages in bulk.\n8. Once all commits are approved, build a single command to stage and commit all files (e.g., 'git add file1 file2 && git commit -m \"message1\" && git add file3 && git commit -m \"message2\"').\n9. Execute the command and remove committed files from the Pending Commits section (do not store them in a Completed Commits section).",
